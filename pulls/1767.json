    "body": "This adds a new representation `geh` of group elements, namely in [homogeneous (also called projective) coordinates](https://hyperelliptic.org/EFD/g1p/auto-shortw-projective.html). This is supposed to be faster for unmixed (i.e., the second summand is not `ge`) addition in terms of field operations, namely 12M+0S+25etc vs. 12M+4S+11etc for [Jacobian coordinates](https://hyperelliptic.org/EFD/g1p/auto-shortw-jacobian.html).\r\n\r\nThe addition and doubling formulas are due to [Renes, Costello, and Batina 2016](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1060), Algorithms 7 and 9. The formulas are complete, i.e., they have no special cases. However, this implementation still keeps track of infinity in a dedicated boolean flag for performance reasons. Since the buckets in Pippenger's algorithm are initialized with infinity (=zero), we'll have many additions involving infinity, and going through the entire formula for each of those hurts performance (and the entire point of this PR is performance).\r\n\r\nThe formulas were implemented by giving GPT-5 mini screenshots of the algorithms in the paper and the `field.h`. The result was not awesome but I could clean it up manually. \r\n\r\nThe new representation is used in Pippenger's ecmult_multi for accumulating the buckets after every window iteration.  Buckets are still constructed as `gej` (because it has faster mixed addition) and only converted to `geh` before accumulation. This is still supposed to be faster even if the conversion is accounted for. The conversion costs 2M+1S but we then do two `geh` additions in a row, saving 8S. This PR has three different variants of how `geh` could be used:\r\n\r\n1. https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/commit/2ccc5e02776b8ae3483adf342b741abd99e48931 Only the inner accumulation loop is done in `geh`.\r\n2. https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/commit/867fe34dd4f642fb966d5ee652e0d77a9adafa41 All of the accumulation is done in `geh`.\r\n3. https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/commit/0fc73f397bc6a10b723b89d6f2a0dc52e7621748 Like the previous, but we switch back to `gej` for rows of doublings.   \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, none of these turns out to be really faster in `ecmult_bench pippenger_wnaf` on my x86_64 system with gcc 15.2.1 or clang 21.1.4. The best variant (2) beats master by just 0.21%; the other variants are slower than master.  :/ If I compile in 32-bit mode, all three variants beat master consistently, but only by 1.2%. But this latter result gives at least some hope that this PR could pay off on some platform. I'm not even sure how much we care about 32-bit platforms. Maybe we care about hardware wallets in general, but probably not when it comes to `ecmult_multi`. Plus this would need real benchmarks; I didn't even run this on a native 32-bit CPU). \r\n\r\n**But we'd certainly care about ARM64 which I couldn't test on. Anyone with an ARM Mac willing to benchmark this?**\r\n\r\nThe exact benchmark command was `SECP256K1_BENCH_ITERS=100000 bench_ecmult pippenger_wnaf` (or `20000` iters for 32-bit). Don't forget the `pippenger_wnaf` argument to make sure you don't benchmark Strauss' algorithm instead, at least below the threshold where we switch to Pippenger automatically. I did this on a 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1260P, pinned to a P-core, and with TurboBoost disabled. See the attached spreadsheet: for details. [benchmark-gcc.ods](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23396505/benchmark-gcc.ods)\r\n\r\nIf you want to benchmark this, I think it makes sense to get four runs per setup: one for the baseline (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/commit/d0f3123c0c2d4643a0191af6e7c5e18032666605, just disabling low point counts in `bench_ecmult` for quicker benchmarking) and the three \"step\" commits as mentioned above. You could just extend the spreadsheet with your results.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you have any ideas on how to improve this further, I'd be happy to hear them. I tried various micro-optimizations, but none of them turned out to be significant on my machine. In fact, most of them made the code slower in practice. In theory, this PR should make it possible to increase the window size a bit, but playing around with the window size didn't make a difference either in practice. \r\n\r\nedit: Don't care about CI. It fails on some platforms because I forgot to mark functions `static`. This should compile locally without issues. ",
