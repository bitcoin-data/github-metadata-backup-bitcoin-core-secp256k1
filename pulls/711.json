    "body": "The issue is that MSVC for 32-bit targets implements 64x64->64 bit multiplications using a non-constant subroutine. The subroutine is not constant-time because it shortcuts when the high 32 bits of both multiplicands are all 0. \r\n\r\nSee https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2017/01/16/when-constant-time-source-may-not-save-you/ and also https://www.bearssl.org/ctmul.html for a broader view of the issue. \r\n\r\nBy inspection of  our 8x32 scalar and 10x26 field code, I found four places in the field code where the \r\nhigh bits are not guaranteed to be zero. \r\n\r\nThis PR inserts VERIFY_CHECKS in the 8x32 scalar code to ensure the high bits are indeed 0.  There, all  ->64 multiplications are in fact 32x32->64.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, this PR modifies the four multiplications in the 10x26 such that the right multiplicand, which is a constant, has never all high bits set to zero. This is ensured by shifting that constant to the left. The costs are two additional shift instructions for shifting the product back to right, for each field element multiplication and doubling. The correctness follows from the VERIFY_BITS statements for the other multiplicands preceeding the multiplications, which ensure that we have enough unused high bits such that the multiplication won't overflow even with the left-shifted constant.\r\n\r\nI feel that this is the most reasonable thing we can do without too much effort and loss of performance.\r\n\r\nPossible alternatives:\r\n - Do the same but with MSVC conditional compilation: I think that's also okay but conditional compilation makes makes testing harder, in particular because noone here uses Windows.\r\n - Write assembly for the multiplication. That may also improve performance for MSVC because their routine is not only variable time but also slow. But this is more work, harder to review and I don't care about performance for MSVC. Moreover, they have a different asm syntax...\r\n - Blacklist the 32-bit for MSVC 32-bit. The drawback is that this leaves us with no option there, and people will probably just comment out the blacklisting. And MSVC is indeed used, for example it's a travis-tested target for rust-secp256k1.  \r\n - Do nothing (and blame the compiler). But I don't think that's clever given that this PR is simple. Of course there are many other non-constant multiplication issues for different platform but I don't think that's a reason to ignore this one.\r\n\r\nIn general, what do people think about pointing out in the README that the library is supposed to be portable but tested tested mostly on gcc and clang, and it's therefore recommend to compile it there if possible? This sounds a little bit like \"Optimized for Netspace Navigator\" but please read https://blog.mozilla.org/nfroyd/2018/05/29/when-implementation-monoculture-right-thing/ for why Mozilla dropped MSVC and how nice clang-cl is as a drop-in replacement for MSVC.\r\n\r\nThis is WIP because I need to add detailed comments, and I first want to see what people think. \r\n\r\nedit: And I had a godbolt environment to play around with this but I lost it. I'll make a new one if people are interested.",

      "body": "It might be better to use verifybits macros in the scalar code, instead of an unstructured verifycheck.\r\n\r\nWith a fair amount effort previously, I extracted our 32bit field multiply instructions and verified it to be free of overflow and (I think) the verifybits statements in frama-c to be free of overflow. If this used the same macros a future redo would pick up the static analysis for free. I got discouraged before because frama-c didn't support __int128, but presumably it (or another tool) would eventually and it might be reasonable to automated running range analysis on the C-language multiplier functions.\r\n\r\nMy main complaint with making it not conditional is that your fix isn't free. (At least I assume it isn't from a glance, haven't tested, if it's not actually a benchmarkable difference on GCC ignore the rest of this comment).\r\n\r\nIt since it's only a few lines it wouldn't be too messy to make conditional. As far as testing goes, this is something we should be able to have CI test. MSVC is a common enough compiler that it's probably worth doing that regardless.\r\n\r\nI wish I saw a way to detect any more of these being added in the codebase. I could detect 64x64->64 on secret inputs  in modified valgrind... but couldn't automatically exclude ones where the high words will not be zero.  It's nice to document that these are the only 64-bit output multiplies that aren't really 32x32->64... as that fact might be really useful for anyone trying to make a SIMD version of these functions.\r\n",

Thus, given a and b,\r\n>     you want a*b mod 2^n. \"b or 2^n\" is really b + 2^n, which is\r\n>     equal to b modulo 2^n, and thus the result is correct.\r\n> \r\n>   - By looking at carries:\r\n> \r\n>     Multiplication is really a bunch of left-shifts and additions\r\n>     (that's the \"schoolbook method\"). When you modify a bit at\r\n>     rank k, it can impact only bits at rank k or higher, because\r\n>     carry propagation in additions is only to the left. So, setting\r\n>     bit 63 in an operand cannot modify bits 0-62 in the result.\r\n> \r\n\r\n\r\nHe also mentioned that a different proper way would be to simply provide our own (inlinable) imlementation of 64x64->64 bit multiplication. That's true. So far I haven't chosen this approach because 1) it would touch more of the existing code, and 2) we don't care about MSVC performance. But if we anyway would enable the workaround proposed in this PR conditionally only on MSVC, and with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17309/commits/162d0038e772bf6210b9218df35c14fd9719d3f7 in mind (which is totally not aware of), maybe we should just fix it the proper way.",

      "body": "@sipa Ok, things got a little messed up in this thread.\r\n\r\n> > way would be to simply provide our own (inlinable) imlementation of 64x64->64 bit multiplication. That's true. So far I haven't chosen this approach because 1) it would touch more of the existing code\r\n> \r\n> One way to do that is to make a MUL_32_32_64 macro, and on msvc it gets converted to an inlinable function call and on everything else it just gets converted to the existing code.\r\n\r\nThis is where the confusion starts. When I read this for the first time (back in July), I assumed @gmaxwell meant to write \"a MUL_64_64_64 macro\". But now I apparently adopted this purported \"typo\"...\r\n\r\nSo there are two different issues.\r\n\r\n### a) 64x64->64 is not constant-time on MSVC\r\nWhat I want to do in order to avoid the variable-time issue is to implement a MUL64_64_64 macro or inlinable function for MSVC, This was suggested by Thomas Pornin along with this canonical implementation\r\n```\r\n    static inline uint64_t\r\n    mul64x64to64(uint64_t x, uint64_t y)\r\n    {\r\n        uint32_t xl, xh, yl, yh;\r\n\r\n        xl = (uint32_t)x;\r\n        xh = (uint32_t)(x >> 32);\r\n        yl = (uint32_t)y;\r\n        yh = (uint32_t)(y >> 32);\r\n        return (uint64_t)xl * (uint64_t)yl\r\n            + ((uint64_t)(xl * yh + xh * yl) << 32);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe tree multiplications in this routine are all formally 32x32->64 muls. MSVC's optimizer detects that correctly and output normal `mul` and `imul` instruction. Even if MSVC implemented the multiplication using its `llmul` routine, the routine is constant-time over 32x32 inputs.\r\n\r\nThis is much more straightforward and also much faster than the solution in this PR.\r\n\r\n### b) 32x32->64 and 64x64->128  macros\r\nThis is just an orthogonal different issue. These macros would make our code work on 32 bit implementations where we don't have a 64 bit type, and on 64 bit implementations where we don't have a 128 bit type (such as MSVC). This would also improve performance on MSVC in cases that MSVC is not clever enough to figure out that a ->64 multiplication is in fact 32x32->64.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Just a heads-up that I have a rewrite of the 10x26 field mul in progress that contains only 32x32 multiplications, amongst other changes.\r\n\r\nThat sounds great and this rewrite would solve a) and at least the 32x32->64 / field part of b). Can you say more? \r\n",

Can you say more?\r\n\r\nNothing too fancy on this score; the new code just avoids multiplying by the 64-bit accumulators.\r\n\r\n> Fast code that uses only 32-bit multiplies would also be a great prototype for a fast N-way SIMD version.\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell My immediate target is an arbitrary-degree Karatsuba (https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1247) rewrite for 10x26, which already has some potential for vectorisation within a single fe_mul. I hope you'll be able to benchmark it on the real hardware in due course.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Maybe just to be super-clear, I'm simply using 32x32->64 multiplies.",
