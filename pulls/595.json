    "body": "This is intended for environments without implementations for `abort()`, `fprintf()`, and `stderr`. e.g., embedded systems. Those can provide their own implementations of `default_illegal_callback_fn` and `default_error_callback_fn` at compile time.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use your own default callback, things will be somewhat inconsistent unfortunately: We cannot make the callback data `extern` too, because then the initialization lists for `default_illegal_callback` won't contain only constants. (`const` variables are not compile-time constants). So you cannot take callback data in your own default callback function.\r\n\r\nAs a more drastic/breaking alternative I suggest to remove the callback data entirely. I don't think it's a big loss and I would be surprised if anyone uses it. Additionally, we could even remove the possibility to set the callback function at runtime after this PR. This will simplify things a lot, and again I don't think it's a big loss.\r\n\r\nNote that `abort()`, `fprintf()`, and `stderr` are also used in `CHECK`, which is still used in production code if we rely on gmp for scalar and field inversions (e.g.,  https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/master/src/scalar_impl.h#L240). This is not an issue for embedded system which probably don't want to use gmp anyway, but it is probably an issue for the reasons explained in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/566#issuecomment-469111901.\r\n\r\n(related downstream: https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-secp256k1/pull/100 @elichai)",

Additionally, we could even remove the possibility to set the callback function at runtime after this PR. This will simplify things a lot, and again I don't think it's a big loss.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of this will be that we could call the error functions from everywhere without carrying around the context. This would make it easier to replace the `CHECK`s in scalar and field inversions without passing the context deeply (and somewhat arbitrarily) into arithmetic functions.",

Replacing the Vec in the DER serialization. I talked with Maxwell and he told me that the signature can be anywhere between 8 and 72 bytes, so the only way I thought I can achieve this without breaking the API is using the ArrayVec crate which initializes the Vector on the stack,\r\nA different approach will be accepting `&mut [u8; 72]` and returning a slice to the correct signature that will be a part of that mutable.",

      "body": "> If you want to use your own default callback, things will be somewhat inconsistent unfortunately: We cannot make the callback data `extern` too, because then the initialization lists for `default_illegal_callback` won't contain only constants. (`const` variables are not compile-time constants). So you cannot take callback data in your own default callback function.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is a problem. The reason for the data pointer is so that you can pass runtime dependent data into the callback. In cases where such runtime data exist, it's always possible to call `secp256k1_context_set_illegal_callback`/`secp256k1_context_set_error_callback`.\r\n\r\n> As a more drastic/breaking alternative I suggest to remove the callback data entirely. I don't think it's a big loss and I would be surprised if anyone uses it. \r\n\r\nHaving searched around a bit, I think this is fine. I'm a bit unclear about how to roll it out - do we just start ignoring the data argument (and cause failure (?) when it's non-null in the `set_*_callback` functions), or do we break the API and rip out the arguments? It's unclear what kind of breaks downstream library tolerate here. There is at least one place I found that actually does call the `set_*_callback` outside of tests: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/crypto/secp256k1/secp256.go .\r\n\r\n> Additionally, we could even remove the possibility to set the callback function at runtime after this PR. This will simplify things a lot, and again I don't think it's a big loss.\r\n\r\nI think that's going too far. There are some places where the library is used in a shared library context, where anything but runtime-set callbacks is unclear at least. Also in situations where the library is used by different layers of a program (say, indrectly through a library like libwally, but also directly for network ECDH negotiations) and those layers want to have distinct behavior.\r\n\r\n> (FWIW, those inverse things should go away because we should get an internal fast inverse and ditch GMP... but thats a lot more than a couple line change :) )\r\n\r\nThat would be great.",

After playing around with the code, I'm rather convinced that having data pointers in default callbacks is fine; it just needs to be documented properly that the default callbacks always need to be prepared to get a NULL pointer. I'll add a commit that updates the header file.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I've experimented also with a branch that allows external pointers to callback data too  (in the end the stupid C99 restriction is not essential and can be worked around).

A better API would be to ask the user to provide entropy already in `_context_create`, or pass NULL explicitly to opt out.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @real-or-random in https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-secp256k1/issues/225#issuecomment-655998672_\r\n\r\nNote that this does not need to be a breaking change, we could for example add a new function and deprecate `secp256k1_context_create`.",
