    "body": "In the course of looking into #1472, I discovered the function `check_fe_equal` and noticed that at two call-sites there is no `CHECK` macro around, i.e. the return value is just thrown away and a failed test would go unnoticed. This seems to be easy to miss, as the name of the function suggests that a check happens, but it's merely a wrapper around `secp256k1_fe_equal` that takes care of normalization.\r\n\r\n(Maybe doing the actual CHECK in `check_fe_equal` would be an option? On the other hand, I guess this makes it harder to spot the cause of a failed assertion, as the line number wouldn't tell anything about from where the function was called.)",
