    "body": "In the course of looking into #1472, I discovered the function `check_fe_equal` and noticed that at two call-sites (from 18 in total) there is no `CHECK` macro around, i.e. the return value is just thrown away and a failed test would go unnoticed. This seems to be easy to miss, as the name of the function suggests that a check happens, but it's merely a wrapper around `secp256k1_fe_equal` that takes care of normalization.\r\n\r\n(Maybe doing the actual CHECK in `check_fe_equal` would be an option? On the other hand, I guess this makes it harder to spot the cause of a failed assertion, as the line number wouldn't tell anything about from where the function was called.)",

They're currently only in `tests.c` but they're utils in the end.\r\n - We have functions with `group_element` and `field_element`, but they should just be `ge` and `fe`.\r\n - The ones in `testutil` should probably also get a `secp256k1_testutil` prefix then. You could say it's good that they stand out currently, but at least that's inconsistent with the ones in `testrand`, which have a prefix. Or perhaps better: we use prefixes `testutil_` and `testrand_`, dropping the additional `secp256k1_` for test functions. Then they still stand out. (The main purpose of `secp256k1_` is to avoid namespace collisions if someone uses the library by just including it, but that doesn't matter in test-only code.)\r\n\r\nNoticed when looking into https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1489.",
