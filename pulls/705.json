If someone PRs a change I would like to check if all lines and all branches of the new code are taken. The summary only shows a number of lines (and branches with `-b`) and waht percentage is exec'd. Even if the numbers stay constant with respect to master that does not mean that the new code is fully tested.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to have travis provide the html coverage report or push it somewhere (github pages, ...)? On the other hand I have no experience with codecov.io, but I have a slight preference for gcov because it works and it does not require a third party.\r\n\r\nFwiw with f8ca9248297c7d40aace74d79cdab7eaf8c52a8a travis either shows gcovr not found or shows an empty code coverage report.",

If someone PRs a change I would like to check if all lines and all branches of the new code are taken. The summary only shows a number of lines (and branches with `-b`) and waht percentage is exec'd. Even if the numbers stay constant with respect to master that does not mean that the new code is fully tested.\r\n\r\nTrue, lines would help a lot more. I thought about running this locally but you're right. For the summary alone, we don't need to setup travis, that's useless.\r\n\r\n> Would it be possible to have travis provide the html coverage report or push it somewhere (github pages, ...)? On the other hand I have no experience with codecov.io, but I have a slight preference for gcov because it works and it does not require a third party.\r\n\r\nAs Greg points out that's hard with Travis. With tools like codevoc.io, this is easier: \r\nhttps://docs.codecov.io/docs/viewing-source-code\r\nOr using coveralls.io:\r\nhttps://coveralls.io/builds/1918/source?filename=lib%2Fcoveralls.rb\r\n\r\nThird parties: Yes, I think that's like with Travis. It's convenient but we should not rely on it or trust it. My concern is rather that we prefer to keep things simple, and just running gcovr is indeed simpler.  \r\nAnd we don't to add tools that disappear in 3 months and we need to redo the work. I'm not sure to be honest. I think I'll can spend some time playing with codecov.io and see how it feels. \r\n\r\n> \r\n> Fwiw with [f8ca924](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/commit/f8ca9248297c7d40aace74d79cdab7eaf8c52a8a) travis either shows gcovr not found or shows an empty code coverage report.\r\n\r\nYep, I need to fix this.",

(https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/451#issuecomment-746752833)\r\n - MacOS builds? (MacOS relies on clang anyway, so not this is not as interesting as MSVC.)\r\n - Coverage reports #705 \r\n - Reducing configuration options to keep the test matrix manageable, see e.g., https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/596#issuecomment-495908309\r\n\r\nIs there anything else you would like to see?\r\n\r\nIf we want to work on this, this is a good time to think about the CI platform. I don't mind Travis and it's reasonably stable in the past months but if we think that a different (or additional) provider is a better fit, it's better to discuss this before we start working on these issues.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Bitcoin is currently looking into GitHub Actions for Windows at least:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17803\r\n",
