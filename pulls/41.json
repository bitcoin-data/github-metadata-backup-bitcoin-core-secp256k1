    "body": "- Selected Co-Z formulas from \"Scalar Multiplication on Weierstraß Elliptic Curves from Co-Z Arithmetic\" (Goundar, Joye, et. al.) added as group methods with new type sep256k1_coz_t.\n- Co-Z methods used for point precomputations in secp256k1_ecmult.\n- WINDOW_A size increased to 6 since the precomputation is much faster per-point.\n- DBLU cost: 3M+4S, ZADDU cost: 5M+2S.\n- From 2.4% to 3.8% faster 'bench' results, depending on configuration.\n\n(UPDATE: Technique explicitly described in https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/051)\n\nIt's probably best to have a read of the paper (http://joye.site88.net/papers/GJMRV11regpm.pdf) if not familiar with Co-Z arithmetic, but roughly it's based on the observations that\n1) points with equal Z coordinate (Co-Z) can be added very cheaply.\n2) an input to a Co-Z double or add can be updated to have the same Z coordinate as the result, almost for free, allowing \"chaining\" of operations.\n\nThis works out well for generating a table of 1P, (2P), 3P, 5P, etc... as the 2P can be created with the same Z as 1P, then added to 1P, 3P, etc., in each case being updated to have the same Z as the previous output, which is also the next input. Then the total cost for a table of 8 values is 3M+4S + 7(5M+2S) = 38M+18S, compared to 3M+4S + 7(12M+4S) = 87M+32S. Alternatively, as this PR does, a table of 16 values can be built instead for 3M+4S + 15(5M+2S) = 78M+34S, which is still cheaper than the current table generation; then ~6 point additions are saved during the scalar multiplication (72M+24S), for a total saving of 72M+24S + 87M+32S - (78M+34S) = 81M+22S, or ~100M.\n\nTiming results for 'bench' across a variety of configurations (bignum=gmp throughout):\n\n| Field | Endo? | Before | After | %Perf |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 64bit | yes | 1m10.623s | 1m8.147s | +3.6% |\n| 64bit | no | 1m35.524s | 1m32.660s | +3.1% |\n| 32bit | yes | 1m43.756s | 1m39.973s | +3.8% |\n| 32bit | no | 2m21.871s | 2m17.690s | +3.0% |\n| gmp | yes | 1m41.278s | 1m37.710s | +3.7% |\n| gmp | no | 2m24.717s | 2m21.326s | +2.4% |\n",

The result of doing so tended to render the numbers much more sparse (more zeros) and thus save a lot of additions.\n",

      "body": "@peterdettman When I recently looked again at your patch I thought you actually were doing the conversion to affine for the multiply, until pieter pointed out to me that it was precomp only... so I guess that intent was clear.  Have you benchmarked it with that? \n\nI estimate from the mul/sqr counts that gej+ge should be about 30% faster than gej+gej, assuming a square takes .7x as long as a mul.  W/ endormphism combined costs in the mutiply loop would be gej+ge 10.1 \\* 16 \\* 2 + gej+gej 14.8 \\* 16 \\* 2 + double 127 \\* 5.8 = 1533.4. vs 1383. Using all ge+ge adds...  so about 10% less weighed field operations in the inner-loop.  Given that saving the final inversion was about a 3% speedup, the affine could reasonably expected to be a win. esp with the known z-ratio trick.    The affine points also use only 2/3rds the memory, so potentially this allows for a larger window.\n",

      "body": "@gmaxwell Yeah, I keep a branch around that uses affine-A in _ecmult(). I measure about %1.5 improvement for bench_verify, but:\n- That's the GMP inversion (unless I missed some developments); it will be hard to match it's performance.\n- _gej_add_ge_var is a little suboptimal still: weak normalisation PR improves it relatively, and I have some code that eliminates two _negates. It's not clear exactly how it will balance out.\n\nOf course, for any sort of batching, it becomes an easy win, even with the exponentiation inversion.\n\nNote that the optimal window size is 6 for co-z alone, but 5 with the inversion. Using affine precomp lowers the per-add cost by 4M+S, but raises the per-precomp cost by the same amount (and it was worse by 2M before I noticed the z-ratios trick). I calculate the theoretical break-even cost of inversion as ~131M (and our multiplication got faster recently :( ).\n\nI tried an alternative scheme where instead of scaling the precomp x,y values by zInv (which costs 3M+S), we just record the zInv. Then a modified gej_add_ge can be used that only needs 1 extra M (i.e. 9M+3S), since we can just scale the gej.z by zInv (for purposes of scaling the \"ge\" x, y). Yeah, that actually does work, but it still works out slower (the math has it costing just 9M more in total, optimal at w=6).\n\nI also tried cacheing the z2, z3 values for the precomp points (when using gej_add of course), since each point is used 2-3 times, but again this was slower in practice (partly due to copying the entire struct when negating the precomp entry, but even after I hacked around that it seems the larger memory footprint was an issue), although it might bear a second attempt in case I fluffed it somehow.\n",
