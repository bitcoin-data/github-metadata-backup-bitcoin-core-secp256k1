But I'm not smart enough to figure that out myself (thanks @jonasnick !) so here we are.\r\n\r\nAPI question: should the xonly version take a scalar or a keypair?\r\n\r\nImpl question: should this implementation live in ecdh, extrakeys, or even a new ecdh_extrakeys module?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

      "body": "Thanks! Unfortunately this may be more involved than you'd expect. \r\n\r\n> In a future world where xonly pubkeys rule, it seems strange to hash\r\nthe y-coordinate.  \r\n\r\nHm, I don't think it's strange. So far, we use 33 bytes pubkeys but hash 64 bytes. Is that strange? I guess not. \r\n\r\nSo my real question is if there are other advantages to hashing only x. Here's one you may not have been aware of: The point multiplication for x-only can be made faster (#262).\r\n\r\n> It also fails if you need to invert one of the\r\nkeys for the ECDH.\r\n\r\nThat's exactly why people didn't like it back then. When \"in doubt\", crypto should rather fail than succeed. So the failure is a feature, and removing it adds a potential footgun. This is exactly why we didn't like #262 back then, see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/262#issuecomment-146189144 for the relevant comments.\r\n\r\nNow I don't think the footgun potential is very high, and if you read the comments there, people weren't strongly opposed to the idea. You could argue that BIP32 derivation and then converting the key to x-only is similar and BIP 340 accepted this fact (very explicitly even: https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-taproot/bip-0340.mediawiki#public-key-conversion). Moreover, X25519 (which is widely used, e.g., in Noise) uses x-only ECDH key and I never heard of any subtle issue, even though RFC7748 has a similar warning:\r\n\r\n >  Designers using these curves should be aware that for each public\r\n   key, there are several publicly computable public keys that are\r\n   equivalent to it, i.e., they produce the same shared secrets.  Thus\r\n   using a public key as an identifier and knowledge of a shared secret\r\n   as proof of ownership (without including the public keys in the key\r\n   derivation) might lead to subtle vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n(https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7748#section-7)\r\n\r\nOf course, all of this depends on the inputs to the ECDH function.\r\nIf it's an x-only -> x-only function, then formally speaking there's no issue because you simply can't negate the input pubkeys. On the other hand, that argument is mood if people effectively derive their x-only keys from full keys.\r\n\r\nTaking a further step back:\r\n\r\n> In a future world where xonly pubkeys rule,\r\n\r\nIs it really true that x-only pubkeys will rule? The way I see x-only pubkeys is that this is mostly an optimization when putting keys on chain. So you can use your normal BIP32/whatever key derivation step and only as the very last step when you're going to use the key on the chain, you drop a byte. But I admit that this is more a rule of thumb than a strict requirement, and I'm not sure if everyone will agree. I think this deserves a broader discussion. In general, I feel we have added a confusing element to BIP340 with x-only keys. ",

My point is if it were 64 bytes, it wouldn't be strange either because the two representations are equivalent (whereas 32 bytes are not equivalent).

Or does it matter?\r\n\r\nYes, this is how I got into this mess. The current scheme breaks: given S1->PK1, S2->PK2, ECDH(S1,PK2) != ECHD(S2,PK1) unless PK1 and PK2 are both even (or maybe both odd, not sure).  I had to invert the secret if its pubkey was 03...\r\n\r\nFurther, interop matters, when setting standards (which is what libsecp256k1 is doing here, no doubt). We could also prepend a BIP-340 style tag, but prepending 02 or 03 is just a weird thing to lock in for future generations to ogle at?\r\n\r\nI know @gmaxwell disliked the malleation which x-only hashing enabled, but that problem doesn't really exist in an x-only world.  With that discounted, the fact that there's a further optimization possible in future is compelling IMHO.",

      "body": "> The current scheme breaks: given S1->PK1, S2->PK2, ECDH(S1,PK2) != ECHD(S2,PK1) unless PK1 and PK2 are both even (or maybe both odd, not sure). I had to invert the secret if its pubkey was 03...\r\n\r\nYes, ok, that's indeed a problem... I hadn't thought that through. Sorry that it took as that many posts to arrive at the core of the problem.\r\n\r\nHere's some background: (as you probably know), the requirement to negate the secret key appears also with signatures. The problem is that you'd need to know the EC point/full pubkey in order to tell whether to negate or not. When we came up with x-only keys in BIP340, our thinking was:\r\n - We want to stay compatible with secret key generation, so we won't touch that part. (And you can stil generate secret keys without computing the public key.)\r\n - For BIP340 sigs, we can do the negation at signing time, because the signing algorithm anyway needs to full pubkey because it's put into the challenge hash. In secp256k1, this led to the keypair type in the API which avoids that you need to recompute the pubkey every time you create a signature, and then our signing function takes key pairs.\r\n\r\nNow this is different in case of ECDH. There's no natural reason to for the ECDH function to take the own pubkey. So what could do? The only possibilities are:\r\n 1. Stick with full keys \r\n 2. Make the ECDH function take a key pair\r\n 3. Hash only the x-coord (this PR)\r\n\r\nI understand you don't like option 1. There's a tendency to re-purpose signature pubkeys (which represent identities) as static keys for key exchange. You can say the ECDH module has been built with this use case in mind, otherwise we'd probably have different datatypes for ECDSA keys and ECDH keys. It's useful in practice, and since BIP340 has x-only keys, people will want to repurpose those x-only keys for ECDH (this PR is an example). Careful crypto engineering tells us that repurposing keys is in general bad practice but in this case we even have a security proof that is very close to what's done in practice [1].\r\n\r\nOption 2 is probably okay. It's a performance penalty but if this is a static key, you need to compute the full pubkey part of the key pair only once.\r\n\r\nBut if we accept that users want to re-purpose x-only signature keys for ECDH, then option 3 is just  strictly better... In particular, option 2 does not protect against the malleability issue either (and we anyway don't have evidence that it does any harm in practice).\r\n\r\n[1] https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/3311",

          "body": "This PR proposes an early version of [Silent Payment](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c43b79517e7cb701ebf77eec6dbb46b8) (author:@RubenSomsen).\r\nIn this scheme, the recipient generates a public address, but the sender tweaks the address and the recipient detects the payment by verifying all transactions on the blockchain. An example use case would be private donations.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is not a final version, but to start the discussion and get benchmarks based on a real implementation.\r\n\r\nThis version is built on top of [#994](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/994) (bitcoin-core/secp256k1) for x-only ECDH support and #23480 (bitcoin/bitcoin) for `rawtr()`. Each new silent transaction detected is stored in wallet as a `rawtr()` descriptor. \r\n\r\nIn this implementation, the sender can tweak the recipient address by passing the `silent_payment` option to send RPC. The transaction output will be different from the address entered.\r\n\r\nFor example `./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named send outputs=\"[{\\\"bcrt1pwlh5xuyrpgfunwyww8cfu78yfs2yqyevl7yturavahh5kgxwdd2q5hzgfu\\\": 1.1}]\" fee_rate=1 options=\"{ \\\"silent_payment\\\": true}\"`.\r\n\r\nwill generate `vout` with completely unrelated outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"vout\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 1.10000000,\r\n      \"n\": 0,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(65b19890c5ca40edb816d26f5f48cd9f3ed51121613b1c2405adc1a6dbbc824a)#8myx9tcu\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pvkce3yx9efqwmwqk6fh47jxdnuld2yfpvya3cfq94hq6dkausf9qrfjkgz\",\r\n\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 2.02499835,\r\n      \"n\": 1,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(c45cb3d500bbf8f0c8841e8e011b008781d826c16ee348edb822c0f97419bc4d)#26hcce63\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pc3wt84gqh0u0pjyyr68qzxcqs7qasfkpdm353mdcytq0jaqeh3xsuvlykg\",\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny wallet, as long as it has access to private keys, can send silent payments. Thus, this excludes watch-only wallets or wallets with external signers .\r\n\r\nBut the recipient's wallet needs a new flag called `SILENT_PAYMENT`. This flag allows an additional scan that verifies that the wallet keys match the silent payment scheme. When it detects a silent payment that belongs to the wallet, it is stored in a `rawtr()` descriptor.\r\n\r\n`./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named createwallet wallet_name=\"recipient\" silent_payment=true`\r\n\r\nTherefore, scanning each address for each transaction is potentially prohibitive overhead, so the node can be initialized with `keypool=1` or a descriptor with range [0,1] can be imported into a blank wallet. Until there is more benchmark data, it is the safest option. The proposal recommends one static address.\r\n\r\nI've been running some silent payments on signet using wallets with default keypool and default range, I haven't noticed any relevant performance drops on the signet node.\r\nApparently this implementation is working as expected but I can't guarantee that the scheme is implemented correctly or safely, so I'm opening this PR for reviews, modifications and improvements.\r\n\r\nThere is a new functional test (`test/functional/wallet_silentpayment.py`) that can help to better understand the implementation.",

          "title": "The principle of just-in-time xonly",
          "body": "I believe that when specifying Bitocin related protocols we should only use xonly keys at the last moment when we need to produce something that goes on chain e.g a key or signature. In retrospect xonly keys may have been a mistake but I think if we take this approach we can minimise the complexity they introduce and maybe make that 1 byte we save worth it!\r\n\r\nOf course is not how the current spec is written. It takes in xonly keys into key aggregation and outputs a key in a kind of hybrid state that can be used to sign with as an xonly key but can also be tweaked as a ordinary key or xonly key. Applying the JIT xonly approach here means taking a two stage key generation approach.  First, the inputs to key aggregation would be ordinary keys and the output would be an ordinary key. This ordinary key could then have bip32 tweaks applied to it. Eventually it could be turned into into a xonly key that could have xonly tweaks applied to it (no bip32 tweaks) and could be used to start a signing session. \r\n\r\nOther than the complexity of all the negation accounting that has to go on with the way the spec is currently written what concerns me most is that people are going to want to do things like \"nested MuSig\" where each MuSig key may be another MuSig key (or even a FROST key). I can't clearly see how badly this will compound the problem but on the other hand I didn't expect xonly keys to introduce this much complexity in the first place.\r\n\r\nSo here's how I see pros and cons:\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n- Less likely to be sprawling complexity with nested schemes or composition with other schemes.\r\n- Only needs a single `gacc` negation flag (instead of the xor of three) applied at signing time. (see below)\r\n- BIP32 applied to keygen input and output is not ambiguous. Since MuSig is creating a xonly key to sign with then how should I apply BIP32 to it? I was thinking I should just put `02` in front of the xonly key. The correct answer is that there is `GetBytes33` which returns the full internal ordinary key. It feels like MuSig can't make up its mind whether it works with xonly keys or not.\r\n- Set the precedent for the JIT xonly approach early so others can avoid mistakenly thinking that xonly inputs to ptotocols is what the experts think is the way to go.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Introduces a two-stage MuSig key state\r\n- Breaks association of xonly as the public key for all schnorr signatures (although FROST will do this anyway so this is a pro to me)\r\n- xonly keys would have to be converted to ordinary keys before being used as inputs in MuSig. You might need a different keypair type for MuSig than for Schnorr.\r\n\r\nFor me the pros  overwhelm the cons. Of course I have left out the \"con\" that this will require some work to rewrite and re-engineer the spec. I had planned to implement all of this in the python spec and make a PR but I was informed that I should make this suggestion as soon as possible because it was looking to be finalised soon.\r\n\r\n### Less negation variables\r\n\r\nIt is obvious why this change would get rid of the need of the `gp/has_even_y(P)` flag . The less obvious result is how `gacc` and `g` can be merged into one. This comes because you can set the initial value of `gacc` to `has_even_y(Q)` when you go from ordinary aggregate key to xonly. In fact you can do this simplification without changing the type of input keys so this suggestion is somewhat orthogonal. For example [here](https://github.com/LLFourn/secp256kfun/pull/97/files#diff-2e97b49f3d4c45ad46b87b0f53c9f7192d85f0aa122b3dab587bd9b7972e0baaR170-R182) I implement the transition from a ordinary aggregate key to a BIP340 xonly aggregate key. This still uses xonly input keys. Though since this change implies a multi-stage keygen context anyway it makes sense that these things go together.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think and whether it's worth pursing doing the python implementation. Sorry again for suggesting big changes this late in the process.\r\n\r\n",

A Jacobi symbol test is required to validate the input. GMP has an appropriate method~~, but the call site is just a TODO in this current code. I would appreciate help in wiring that up if anyone wants to volunteer~~.\n2. The output is only an x-coord. The y-coord _could_ be recovered... at the cost of a sqrt! AFAIK there's no cheap way to get even the sign bit. Still, I think needing only the x-coord is a fairly common use case, though I don't know if/how bitcoin uses ECDH.\n\nNOTE: The input is currently also just a field element, but it could perhaps be a point, with this optimization only applied if it is in compressed format.\n\nI measure an 8.5% performance improvement for bench_ecdh_xo vs bench_ecdh. The final numbers will depend mostly on how expensive the Jacobi symbol test is, but it should be considerably cheaper than the sqrt.\n",
