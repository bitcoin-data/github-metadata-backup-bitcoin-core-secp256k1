But I'm not smart enough to figure that out myself (thanks @jonasnick !) so here we are.\r\n\r\nAPI question: should the xonly version take a scalar or a keypair?\r\n\r\nImpl question: should this implementation live in ecdh, extrakeys, or even a new ecdh_extrakeys module?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

      "body": "Thanks! Unfortunately this may be more involved than you'd expect. \r\n\r\n> In a future world where xonly pubkeys rule, it seems strange to hash\r\nthe y-coordinate.  \r\n\r\nHm, I don't think it's strange. So far, we use 33 bytes pubkeys but hash 64 bytes. Is that strange? I guess not. \r\n\r\nSo my real question is if there are other advantages to hashing only x. Here's one you may not have been aware of: The point multiplication for x-only can be made faster (#262).\r\n\r\n> It also fails if you need to invert one of the\r\nkeys for the ECDH.\r\n\r\nThat's exactly why people didn't like it back then. When \"in doubt\", crypto should rather fail than succeed. So the failure is a feature, and removing it adds a potential footgun. This is exactly why we didn't like #262 back then, see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/262#issuecomment-146189144 for the relevant comments.\r\n\r\nNow I don't think the footgun potential is very high, and if you read the comments there, people weren't strongly opposed to the idea. You could argue that BIP32 derivation and then converting the key to x-only is similar and BIP 340 accepted this fact (very explicitly even: https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-taproot/bip-0340.mediawiki#public-key-conversion). Moreover, X25519 (which is widely used, e.g., in Noise) uses x-only ECDH key and I never heard of any subtle issue, even though RFC7748 has a similar warning:\r\n\r\n >  Designers using these curves should be aware that for each public\r\n   key, there are several publicly computable public keys that are\r\n   equivalent to it, i.e., they produce the same shared secrets.  Thus\r\n   using a public key as an identifier and knowledge of a shared secret\r\n   as proof of ownership (without including the public keys in the key\r\n   derivation) might lead to subtle vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n(https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7748#section-7)\r\n\r\nOf course, all of this depends on the inputs to the ECDH function.\r\nIf it's an x-only -> x-only function, then formally speaking there's no issue because you simply can't negate the input pubkeys. On the other hand, that argument is mood if people effectively derive their x-only keys from full keys.\r\n\r\nTaking a further step back:\r\n\r\n> In a future world where xonly pubkeys rule,\r\n\r\nIs it really true that x-only pubkeys will rule? The way I see x-only pubkeys is that this is mostly an optimization when putting keys on chain. So you can use your normal BIP32/whatever key derivation step and only as the very last step when you're going to use the key on the chain, you drop a byte. But I admit that this is more a rule of thumb than a strict requirement, and I'm not sure if everyone will agree. I think this deserves a broader discussion. In general, I feel we have added a confusing element to BIP340 with x-only keys. ",

My point is if it were 64 bytes, it wouldn't be strange either because the two representations are equivalent (whereas 32 bytes are not equivalent).

Or does it matter?\r\n\r\nYes, this is how I got into this mess. The current scheme breaks: given S1->PK1, S2->PK2, ECDH(S1,PK2) != ECHD(S2,PK1) unless PK1 and PK2 are both even (or maybe both odd, not sure).  I had to invert the secret if its pubkey was 03...\r\n\r\nFurther, interop matters, when setting standards (which is what libsecp256k1 is doing here, no doubt). We could also prepend a BIP-340 style tag, but prepending 02 or 03 is just a weird thing to lock in for future generations to ogle at?\r\n\r\nI know @gmaxwell disliked the malleation which x-only hashing enabled, but that problem doesn't really exist in an x-only world.  With that discounted, the fact that there's a further optimization possible in future is compelling IMHO.",

      "body": "> The current scheme breaks: given S1->PK1, S2->PK2, ECDH(S1,PK2) != ECHD(S2,PK1) unless PK1 and PK2 are both even (or maybe both odd, not sure). I had to invert the secret if its pubkey was 03...\r\n\r\nYes, ok, that's indeed a problem... I hadn't thought that through. Sorry that it took as that many posts to arrive at the core of the problem.\r\n\r\nHere's some background: (as you probably know), the requirement to negate the secret key appears also with signatures. The problem is that you'd need to know the EC point/full pubkey in order to tell whether to negate or not. When we came up with x-only keys in BIP340, our thinking was:\r\n - We want to stay compatible with secret key generation, so we won't touch that part. (And you can stil generate secret keys without computing the public key.)\r\n - For BIP340 sigs, we can do the negation at signing time, because the signing algorithm anyway needs to full pubkey because it's put into the challenge hash. In secp256k1, this led to the keypair type in the API which avoids that you need to recompute the pubkey every time you create a signature, and then our signing function takes key pairs.\r\n\r\nNow this is different in case of ECDH. There's no natural reason to for the ECDH function to take the own pubkey. So what could do? The only possibilities are:\r\n 1. Stick with full keys \r\n 2. Make the ECDH function take a key pair\r\n 3. Hash only the x-coord (this PR)\r\n\r\nI understand you don't like option 1. There's a tendency to re-purpose signature pubkeys (which represent identities) as static keys for key exchange. You can say the ECDH module has been built with this use case in mind, otherwise we'd probably have different datatypes for ECDSA keys and ECDH keys. It's useful in practice, and since BIP340 has x-only keys, people will want to repurpose those x-only keys for ECDH (this PR is an example). Careful crypto engineering tells us that repurposing keys is in general bad practice but in this case we even have a security proof that is very close to what's done in practice [1].\r\n\r\nOption 2 is probably okay. It's a performance penalty but if this is a static key, you need to compute the full pubkey part of the key pair only once.\r\n\r\nBut if we accept that users want to re-purpose x-only signature keys for ECDH, then option 3 is just  strictly better... In particular, option 2 does not protect against the malleability issue either (and we anyway don't have evidence that it does any harm in practice).\r\n\r\n[1] https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/3311",
