      "body": "Here's an unresolved issue I'd like to discuss before I proceed. It's not clear to me what we should do with `secp256k1_context_no_precomp`:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/da0092bccc0ebd67e943e7313143800b1da265ec/include/secp256k1.h#L200-L205 \r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that so far, you couldn't call functions requiring ecmult or ecmult_gen with `secp256k1_context_no_precomp`. #956 has changed this for ecmult (verification tables) and this PR (in its current state) would change this also for ecmult_gen (signing tables). But while we don't need any context anymore for ecmult, we'd still retain an ecmult_gen_context for holding blinding values.\r\n\r\nWith the current PR, using `secp256k1_context_no_precomp` with an ecmult_gen function would simply give you wrong results because the ecmult_gen_context within there is not correctly initialized, i.e., the blinding values are not consistent.\r\n\r\nHere are possible approaches:\r\n - Change `secp256k1_context_no_precomp` to include \"default\" blinding values. This makes it possible to use this context for ecmult_gen functions but effectively turns off blinding, so this has the same drawbacks as as creating a normal context and not randomizing it. Note that `secp256k1_context_no_precomp` is a constant, so the user can't ever randomize it.\r\n   - We could then optionally add a warning to `secp256k1_context_no_precomp`.\r\n   - Or we could even deprecate it. Arguably, the main advantage of it is gone when there's anyway no \"precomp\" anymore. But a minor advantage of it is that it's static which may be a useful thing when you really only want to run a parsing function.\r\n - Effectively retain the distinction between signing contexts and non-signing contexts. In that world, `secp256k1_context_no_precomp` is currently the only way to obtain a non-signing context.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, we should anyway reconsider the context API (#780), so this is only an intermediate step. Having said this, I think both options are acceptable (slightly leaning towards the second) but I'd like to do the bikeshedding before I continue to work on this. ",

This is fixed now (bitcoin-core/secp256k1#966), and the cast is removed in this PR.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other relevant changes:\r\n* (bitcoin-core/secp256k1#956): replaces a runtime-computed table with a precomputed one; this adds arouns 1 MiB to the binary size, but is a step towards significantly simplifying the API. If 1 MiB is too much, it can be reduced by 2 or 4 (or more) for a slight verification performance reduction.\r\n* (bitcoin-core/secp256k1#983): removes (test/bench only) OpenSSL support entirely, removing the need to pass `--disable-openssl-tests` (see #23314).\r\n* (bitcoin-core/secp256k1#810): mild performance increase for 64-bit non-x86 platforms.\r\n* (bitcoin-core/secp256k1#1002): Make aux_rnd32==NULL behave identical to 0x0000..00 (which impacts BIP341/BIP342 signing in Bitcoin Core, making it more strictly BIP340 compliant, though not in a manner that affects security).",

      "message": "ecmult_gen: Simplify ecmult_gen context after making table static\n\nThis is a backwards-compatible API change: Before this commit, a context\ninitialized for signing was required to call functions that rely on\necmult_gen. After this commit, this is no longer necessary because the\nstatic ecmult_gen table is always present. In practice this means that\nthe corresponding functions will just work instead of calling the\nillegal callback when given a context which is not (officially)\ninitialized for signing.\n\nThis is in line with 6815761, which made the analogous change with\nrespect to ecmult and contexts initialized for signing. But as opposed\nto 681571, which removed the ecmult context entirely, we cannot remove\nthe ecmult_gen context entirely because it is still used for random\nblinding. Moreover, since the secp256k1_context_no_precomp context is\nconst and cannot meaningfully support random blinding, we refrain (for\nnow) from changing its API, i.e., the illegal callback will still be\ncalled when trying to use ecmult_gen operations with the static\nsecp256k1_context_no_precomp context.",

Especially in wasm32-unknown-unknown you have no syscalls or way of getting entropy, so this could be problematic.\r\n\r\nFully isolated WASM is really great to provide first-class support for for a myriad of reasons, but we'd need to think through carefully exactly what we do. Maybe we can detect if we're in wasm and disable some targets if we don't have symbols for getting entropy linked? Not sure :)",

And anyway, they target gcc and clang for x86_64, which is covered by the Linux jobs already. (And they currently fail due to some homebrew server being down but that's a different issue...)\r\n\r\nI'm working on a further PR that adds MSVCs build on native Windows. This will give us a real new dimension in the configuration space.  And there's still the idea to build with multiple versions of gcc and clang.",

The (Jacobian) result point of each scalar multiplication is then mapped back via (x, y, z) => (x, y, z.u). Correctness depends on the group operations not involving the curve's 'B' parameter, which would have to be B.u^6 if it was being used.\r\n\r\nCurrently the static precomp. gets a randomised table but not the iso, so doesn't work.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR modifies _ecmult_gen_blind so that (repeated) calls with a NULL seed no longer reset the blinding each time. There was a test that exercised that reset, which I disabled, but it makes me wonder if there was some purpose to this.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Fixed mapping equation",

          "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nRight now secp256k1 has a `ecmult-static-precomputation` module which allows us to trade space for speed. However the precomputation is only activated in secp256k1_ecmult_gen_context used in signing part. In our case we want to enable the precomputation in secp256k1_ecmult_context used in verification part as well.\r\n\r\nWe do have a patch that is mostly working [here](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/secp256k1/commit/3ffde18a060aaf4df5b81e7d88355f1e99874650), and we are interested in submitting it to upstream. However, the result here, is that a 512KB code size increase(actually 1MB if endomorphism is also enabled). So before wasting everyone's time, we want to first check the best possible way going forward here. Should we put it in a second flag so we can disable it by default and enable it on demand? Or is it good enough to share the same precomputation flag?\r\n\r\nMany thanks!",

It currently computes fixed values which could be made static (open PR: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1120)\r\n- [ ] Document (or set by default) build options to remove unused static tables (and code) when no signing/verification function is called (something like `--disable-shared CFLAGS=\"-fdata-sections -ffunction-sections -O2 -g\" LDFLAGS=\"-Wl,--gc-sections\"`)\r\n- [x] Document the backwards-compatible API changes made in #988 and in #956: All contexts except the `no_precomp` context are now effectively signing contexts. The `no_precomp` context is effectively a verification context., and name is misleading as no context uses dynamic precompuation now. The reason why `no_precomp` is different is that it's impossible to re-randomize it.\r\n- [x] Decide what to do with the `no_precomp` context: Possibilities include: renaming it, deprecating it (its main user rust-secp256k1 won't like this), and/or promote it a full signing context, maybe with a verbose name such as \"global-context-less-secure\" in the spirit of what rust-secp256k1 is doing.   \r\n   ",

Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",

I refrained from linking to the PR as the template proposed for multiple reasons:\r\n - Including the PR title is not in line with the suggestions in https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/ What they do instead is really just describe what parts in the API have changed, and I tend to agree that this is better for the user. The PR title can be rather technical or saying not too much, and a PR can correspond to multiple changes (for example this PR).\r\n - I'd be open to Include a link to the PR but I feel it's a little bit annoying because you get the PR number only after creating the PR... Also I think the changelog is addressed to our users, not our devs. It should be just a log of user-visible changes (syntax and visible API behavior), so we anyway shouldn't include every PR. \r\n\r\nA normal strategy would be to create a release first, then make the API changes, but in this case, this would be somewhat confusing. The important thing here is the changes made to context flags and these are already for quite some time, so it makes sense to document these even for the initial release.",

Autoconf supports this fairly cleanly via the `AX_PROG_CC_FOR_BUILD` macro (from Autoconf Archive), but Automake requires some hackery. When building the generators, we override the `CC`, `CFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS`, and `LDFLAGS` variables to their build-system counterparts, whose names are suffixed with `_FOR_BUILD` and whose values are populated by the aforementioned Autoconf macro and may be overridden on the `make` command line. Since Automake lacks support for overriding `EXEEXT` on a per-program basis, we define a recipe that builds the generator binaries with names suffixed with `$(EXEEXT)` and then renames them suffixed with `$(BUILD_EXEEXT)`.",
