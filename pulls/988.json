      "body": "Here's an unresolved issue I'd like to discuss before I proceed. It's not clear to me what we should do with `secp256k1_context_no_precomp`:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/da0092bccc0ebd67e943e7313143800b1da265ec/include/secp256k1.h#L200-L205 \r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that so far, you couldn't call functions requiring ecmult or ecmult_gen with `secp256k1_context_no_precomp`. #956 has changed this for ecmult (verification tables) and this PR (in its current state) would change this also for ecmult_gen (signing tables). But while we don't need any context anymore for ecmult, we'd still retain an ecmult_gen_context for holding blinding values.\r\n\r\nWith the current PR, using `secp256k1_context_no_precomp` with an ecmult_gen function would simply give you wrong results because the ecmult_gen_context within there is not correctly initialized, i.e., the blinding values are not consistent.\r\n\r\nHere are possible approaches:\r\n - Change `secp256k1_context_no_precomp` to include \"default\" blinding values. This makes it possible to use this context for ecmult_gen functions but effectively turns off blinding, so this has the same drawbacks as as creating a normal context and not randomizing it. Note that `secp256k1_context_no_precomp` is a constant, so the user can't ever randomize it.\r\n   - We could then optionally add a warning to `secp256k1_context_no_precomp`.\r\n   - Or we could even deprecate it. Arguably, the main advantage of it is gone when there's anyway no \"precomp\" anymore. But a minor advantage of it is that it's static which may be a useful thing when you really only want to run a parsing function.\r\n - Effectively retain the distinction between signing contexts and non-signing contexts. In that world, `secp256k1_context_no_precomp` is currently the only way to obtain a non-signing context.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, we should anyway reconsider the context API (#780), so this is only an intermediate step. Having said this, I think both options are acceptable (slightly leaning towards the second) but I'd like to do the bikeshedding before I continue to work on this. ",

But yes, this should go to a follow-up PR. I'm adding it to the list in the opening comment. This PR just makes the ecmult_gen tables use the same build method as the ecmult tables already use. \r\n\r\nedit: I didn't think this through entirely but this could also further simplify the build system. Generating `.c` files does not need `BUILT_SOURCES`, see Section \"Build bindir.c, not bindir.h.\" in https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Built-Sources-Example.html.   \r\n",

      "message": "ecmult_gen: Simplify ecmult_gen context after making table static\n\nThis is a backwards-compatible API change: Before this commit, a context\ninitialized for signing was required to call functions that rely on\necmult_gen. After this commit, this is no longer necessary because the\nstatic ecmult_gen table is always present. In practice this means that\nthe corresponding functions will just work instead of calling the\nillegal callback when given a context which is not (officially)\ninitialized for signing.\n\nThis is in line with 6815761, which made the analogous change with\nrespect to ecmult and contexts initialized for signing. But as opposed\nto 681571, which removed the ecmult context entirely, we cannot remove\nthe ecmult_gen context entirely because it is still used for random\nblinding. Moreover, since the secp256k1_context_no_precomp context is\nconst and cannot meaningfully support random blinding, we refrain (for\nnow) from changing its API, i.e., the illegal callback will still be\ncalled when trying to use ecmult_gen operations with the static\nsecp256k1_context_no_precomp context.",
