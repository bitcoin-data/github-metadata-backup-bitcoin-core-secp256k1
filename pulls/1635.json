    "body": "This PR adds a \"hazmat\" [1] module for accessing internal data structures and functions (scalar and point for now), with the idea that other libraries could build on top of that. The implementation is inspired by [secp256k1-zkp/#153](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp/pull/153), but aims to provide data types that can be allocated on the stack instead of the heap, as it seems to be significantly simpler from a user perspective if the burden of dynamic memory management can be avoided. The approach to achieve this is by using a \"shell type\" with fixed size and alignment that hosts the underlying structure not visible to the user [2], eg for scalar:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntypedef union {\r\n    unsigned char data[32];\r\n    uint64_t align8; /* ensure alignment on 8-bytes boundaries */\r\n} secp256k1_hazmat_scalar;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the alignment enforcing dummy, the compiler emits warnings like `\"warning: cast from 'const secp256k1_hazmat_scalar *' to 'secp256k1_scalar *' increases required alignment from 1 to 8 [-Wcast-align]\"` when the public type is converted to the underlying internal type via casting. This admittedly looks a bit fishy and I'm not sure if this is even standard-compliant C89, so would appreciate feedback particularly on that. \r\n\r\nFor exposing the ge/gej types,  a \"smart\" point object is used that stores the result in jacobi coordinates together with a \"z-is-one\" flag and converts to affine coordinates when needed (which is trivial by simply assigning x/y if that flag is set). For multiplication with the generator point, a secp256k1 context object is needed, as otherwise it wouldn't be possible to take use of the optimized and more secure variant.\r\n\r\nSee the added example for how this module could be used in practice.\r\n\r\nFor further open questions, see the earlier writeup https://gist.github.com/theStack/0893258c3aba91c28539b9334d2e0608.\r\n\r\n[1] =\"hazardous material\"; this terminology origins in Python's  [`pyca/cryptography`](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography) library, see https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/ (_\"You should ONLY use it if you’re 100% absolutely sure that you know what you’re doing because this module is full of land mines, dragons, and dinosaurs with laser guns.\"_)\r\n[2] see e.g. https://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2019/01/opaque-types-and-static-allocation.html",

      "body": "tACK 1123e352be6a9474df4feda1a6bbbc003cbea1ae  \r\n- I ran some out-of-tree benchmarks on the scalar APIs of hazmat module using the same initializers and structure as `bench_internal`. As expected, hazmat was consistently slower, with the gap increasing for larger or denser scalars. From what I can tell, this is due to stricter boundaries and reduced inlining rather than allocation behavior, since both hazmat and internal APIs are allocation-free for the scalars in the test. This isn’t meant as a performance critique — just an observation in case it’s useful context. It might be worth briefly noting in the PR description that this PoC isn’t targeting speed, so readers don’t infer that from the benchmarks.\r\n- I also reproduced the warning mentioned in the description (on macOS M1). Just confirming that I see the same behavior on my side in case that’s helpful.\r\nOne small question from my side: does this PoC change any assumptions about how scalars are intended to be passed or stored across API boundaries? I want to make sure I’m understanding the intended usage correctly.\r\n\r\nHappy to share the benchmark code or numbers if that would be useful.",
