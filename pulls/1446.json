    "body": "Widely available versions of GCC and Clang beat our field asm on -O2.\r\nIn particular, GCC 10.5.0, which is Bitcoin Core's current compiler\r\nfor official x86_64 builds, produces code that is > 20% faster for\r\nfe_mul and > 10% faster for signature verification (see #726).\r\n\r\nThese are the alternatives to this PR:\r\n\r\nWe could replace our current asm with the fastest compiler output\r\nthat we can find. This is potentially faster, but it has multiple\r\ndrawbacks:\r\n - It's more coding work because it needs detailed benchmarks (e.g.,\r\n   with many compiler/options).\r\n - It's more review work because we need to deal with inline asm\r\n   (including clobbers etc.) and there's a lack of experts reviewers\r\n   in this area.\r\n - It's not unlikely that we'll fall behind again in a few compiler\r\n   versions, and then we have to deal with this again, i.e., redo the\r\n   benchmarks. Given our history here, I doubt that we'll revolve\r\n   this timely.\r\n\r\nWe could change the default of the asm build option to off. But this\r\nwill also disable the scalar asm, which is still faster.\r\n\r\nWe could split the build option into two separate options for field\r\nand scalar asm and only disable the field asm by default. But this\r\nadds complexity to the build and to the test matrix.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is that this PR gets the low-hanging fruit in terms of\r\nperformance. It simplifies our code significantly. It's clearly an\r\nimprovement, and it's very easy to review. Whether re-introducing\r\nbetter asm (whether from a compiler or from CryptOpt) is worth the\r\nhassle can be evaluated separately, and should not hold up this\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nSolves #726.",

      "message": "field: Remove x86_64 asm\n\nWidely available versions of GCC and Clang beat our field asm on -O2.\nIn particular, GCC 10.5.0, which is Bitcoin Core's current compiler\nfor official x86_64 builds, produces code that is > 20% faster for\nfe_mul and > 10% faster for signature verification (see #726).\n\nThese are the alternatives to this PR:\n\nWe could replace our current asm with the fastest compiler output\nthat we can find. This is potentially faster, but it has multiple\ndrawbacks:\n - It's more coding work because it needs detailed benchmarks (e.g.,\n   with many compiler/options).\n - It's more review work because we need to deal with inline asm\n   (including clobbers etc.) and there's a lack of experts reviewers\n   in this area.\n - It's not unlikely that we'll fall behind again in a few compiler\n   versions, and then we have to deal with this again, i.e., redo the\n   benchmarks. Given our history here, I doubt that we'll revolve\n   this timely.\n\nWe could change the default of the asm build option to off. But this\nwill also disable the scalar asm, which is still faster.\n\nWe could split the build option into two separate options for field\nand scalar asm and only disable the field asm by default. But this\nadds complexity to the build and to the test matrix.\n\nMy conclusion is that this PR gets the low-hanging fruit in terms of\nperformance. It simplifies our code significantly. It's clearly an\nimprovement, and it's very easy to review. Whether re-introducing\nbetter asm (whether from a compiler or from CryptOpt) is worth the\nhassle can be evaluated separately, and should not hold up this\nimprovement.\n\nSolves #726.",
