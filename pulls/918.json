    "body": "gen_context: Don't include basic-config.h\r\n\r\nBefore this commit, gen_context.c both included libsecp256k1-config.h\r\nand basic-config.h: The former only to obtain ECMULT_GEN_PREC_BITS\r\nand the latter to obtain a basic working configuration to be able to\r\nuse the library.\r\n\r\nThis was inelegant and confusing: It meant that basic-config.h needs\r\nto #undef all the macros defined in libsecp256k1-config.h. Moreover,\r\nit meant that basic-config.h cannot define ECMULT_GEN_PREC_BITS,\r\nessentially making this file specific for use in gen_context.c.\r\n\r\nAfter this commit, gen_context.c include only libsecp256k1-config.h.\r\nbasic-config.h is not necessary anymore for the modules used in\r\ngen_context.c because 79f1f7a made the preprocessor detect all the\r\nrelevant config options.\r\n\r\nOn the way, we remove an unused #define in basic-config.h.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis now cherrypicks https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/918/commits/71d76d1b3cb0480620a2071c5cdee033218eb37d from #918.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, basic-config.h is unused. We could simply remove it. But with the goal of improving non-autotools (#622) in mind, I don't think that's the best approach. Here are better options:\r\n\r\n * We keep the file and it can help users to facilitate non-autotools builds. (This would mean we'll merge #916 on top of this PR, which now should work properly now).\r\n * We take a step back and think about a better solution for non-autotools builds. I'm willing to work on a PR.\r\n   * The library currently builds cleanly with a simply compiler invocation except that `ECMULT_WINDOW_SIZE` and `ECMULT_GEN_PREC_BITS` are not defined. So I suggest we define default values for those in the corresponding files. Then the library would be cleanly without any necessary config.\r\n   * We provide the user with a template config file that documents the available config options. Creating such a template is not too hard using autotools, which supports this for the specific purpose of allowing non-autotools builds.\r\n   * We add a (then hopefully simple) section to the README that explains building without autotools.\r\n   * We add a CI job that tests that the build works with the command from the README.

We have some experience with Python code for EC arithmetic already, it'd be more than performant enough for this purpose, constant-timeness is not a concern, and the result would still be subject to all tests of the resulting build (though we way want to add a test that is designed to access all table entries). That would avoid all complications the current build system has that result from cross-compilation.\r\n\r\nOur current code comes with a  lot of autotools complexity and can be annoying for the user when it comes to cross-compilation but the approach is pretty solid nowadays. I'm not convinced that a build dependency on Python will be less annoying on average.\r\n\r\nBut isn't the real solution here to simply add the generated files to the repo, ideally for all supported values of `ECMULT_GEN_PREC_BITS`? This will save the user all the trouble and we're free to do whatever we like in the backend (keep the current approach or switch to Python). Here's a table of file sizes:\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n    <td>ECMULT_GEN_PREC_BITS\r\n    <td>raw\r\n    <td>gzipped\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>2\r\n\t<td>107 kB\r\n\t<td>47 kB\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>4\r\n\t<td>213 kB\r\n\t<td>92 kB\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>8\r\n\t<td>1695 kB\r\n\t<td>720 kB\r\n<tr>\r\n    <td>(current repo size)\r\n\t<td>1190 kB\r\n\t<td>218 kB\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nAll of this is not an issue. If we care, we can restrict the constant to be 2 or 4. Nobody will need 8 and we anyway want to make the test matrix smaller. \r\n\r\n> \r\n> Other than that... it feels a bit strange to treat this ECMULT_GEN_PREC_BITS configuration for gen_context different from everything else, but I don't see a better solution.\r\n\r\nYeah it's not elegant but it would work.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Another vague thought: I think we should aim for having the library not requiring any `#define`s at all for building (except for weird platforms where e.g. endianness/64bitness detection fail, or for deviating from defaults like ecmult table size, or for things that require explicit build system support like the arm assembly). With the changes to make endianness and 64bitness automatically detected at compile time, I think we're most of the way there.\r\n\r\nRight, as I said above, we're almost there for a basic config. The only missing thing is defaults for the two tweak values of `ECMULT_GEN_PREC_BITS` and `ECMULT_WINDOW_SIZE`. After we have those, the library should always compile. You may not get ASM or precomputation but at least it will work out of the box.",

Moreover,\nit meant that basic-config.h cannot define ECMULT_GEN_PREC_BITS,\nessentially making this file specific for use in gen_context.c.\n\nAfter this commit, gen_context.c include only libsecp256k1-config.h.\nbasic-config.h is not necessary anymore for the modules used in\ngen_context.c because 79f1f7a made the preprocessor detect all the\nrelevant config options.\n\nOn the way, we remove an unused #define in basic-config.h.",

Generally, the \"we take a step back plan\" sounds like a good solution to #622 to me.\r\n\r\nI think if we keep the file for now, then we should keep this ifdef for now to avoid touching the \"API\". Some people may define the macro conditionally.\r\n\r\nWe'll probably remove the file later but then at least we interrupt the compile process of users only once then.\r\n\r\n",

Everything else includes just util, not the config directly (because the config only overrides things for autodetection)\r\n> - building without -D… anything gives you exactly the defaults/autodetected values, nothing else\r\n> - with extensions util.h could also work without HAVE_CONFIG_H\r\n\r\nThis sounds very reasonable to me.",

      "body": "> With #693 the number of possible configurations for the ecmult_gen table will go up a lot though, \r\n\r\nI know I said this on IRC-- but I see it's not here.  The configurations there shouldn't go up: It's not a good use of resources to test a large number of configurations and 99.999999% of users will have no more idea how to set these things than we do.  Instead, there should be a small number of exposed configurations (like small, medium, large) just for protecting the sanity of the user and the testability of the software -- and as a side effect it keeps the shipped configurations manageable.
