    "body": "Yep, yet another visiblity PR :)\r\n\r\nNoticed this when building libbitcoinkernel for Linux. Core needs a way to link a static secp into a (shared or static) kernel without exporting the secp symbols.\r\n\r\nautotools defines `DLL_EXPORT` for dll builds. CMake mimics this behavior and defines `SECP256K1_DLL_EXPORT`.\r\n\r\nThis means that currently Windows builds only export their symbols for shared libraries, and all other platforms export for shared AND static.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there's no way to make autotools define a special variable when building for other platforms.\r\n\r\nCMake could define a variable for shared lib builds on all platforms, which the header could then use to decide whether or not to export symbols, but that would introduce a behavioral difference between the build-systems.\r\n\r\nInstead, provide an escape hatch via `SECP256K1_NO_EXPORTS` which can be used when building secp for non-Windows targets when exports are not desired (when building a static lib).",

      "message": "build: Add SECP256K1_NO_EXPORTS option to avoid default visibility for static libs\n\nautotools defines DLL_EXPORT for dll builds. CMake mimics this behavior and\ndefines SECP256K1_DLL_EXPORT.\n\nThis means that currently Windows builds only export their symbols for shared\nlibraries, and all other platforms export for shared AND static.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no way to make autotools define a special variable when\nbuilding for other platforms.\n\nCMake could define a variable for shared lib builds on all platforms, which the\nheader could then use to decide whether or not to export symbols, but that\nwould introduce a behavioral difference between the build-systems.\n\nInstead, provide an escape hatch via SECP256K1_NO_EXPORTS which can be used\nwhen building secp for non-Windows targets when exports are not desired (when\nbuilding a static lib).",
