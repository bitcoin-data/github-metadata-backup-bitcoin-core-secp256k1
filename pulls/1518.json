          "body": "EDIT: based on #1518. Closes #1452. Most of the code is a copy from [libsecp256k1-zkp](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp). The API added in this PR is identical with the exception of two modifications:\r\n\r\n1. I removed the unused `scratch_space` argument from `secp256k1_musig_pubkey_agg`. This argument was intended to allow using `ecmult_multi` algorithms for key aggregation in the future. But at this point it's unclear whether the `scratch_space` object will remain in its current form (see #1302).\r\n2. Support for adaptor signatures was removed and therefore the `adaptor` argument of `musig_nonce_process` was also removed.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the module in libsecp256k1-zkp, the module is non-experimental. I slightly cleaned up parts of the module, adjusted the code to the new definition of the VERIFY_CHECK macro and applied some simplifications that were possible because the module is now in the upstream repo (`ge_from_bytes`, `ge_to_bytes`). You can follow the changes I made to the libsecp256k1-zkp module at https://github.com/jonasnick/secp256k1-zkp/commits/musig2-upstream/.\r\n",

      "body": "Concept ACK. This is useful independently of MuSig and Silent Payments. Also for users with no standard library, e.g., on hardware wallets.\r\n\r\ncc @roconnor-blockstream who wrote most of this code\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nJust out of curiosity, I checked what glibc actually does. They have Quicksort, Insertionsort, Mergesort, and Heapsort in their code base. [If malloc fails, they'll always fall back to Heapsort.](https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/14e56bd4ce15ac2d1cc43f762eb2e6b83fec1afe/stdlib/qsort.c#L361-L368) I think they had been using Quicksort and Mergesort for decades (perhaps selected depending on the platform?), but they changed their mind quite often lately, and this was indeed related to degenerate and adversarially constructed inputs: \r\n -  Oct 2023: They added Heapsort and used it to implement Introsort. Introsort is basically Quicksort two fallbacks: 1) a fallback on some O(n log n) sorting algorithm in degenerate cases, and 2) a fallback on Insertion sort for small arrays (https://github.com/bminor/glibc/commit/274a46c9b25ab733a1fb9fb1497f1beecae30193). They had also removed Mergesort, making Introsort the algorithm used everywhere. (https://github.com/bminor/glibc/commit/03bf8357e8291857a435afcc3048e0b697b6cc04)\r\n -  Nov 2023: The logic for the fallback to Heapsort was tightened, and a test with a degerate array. (https://github.com/bminor/glibc/commit/64e4acf24da15c11cb83f933947df3b2e8a700cd: \"To avoid a denial-of-service condition with adversarial input, it is necessary to fall over to heapsort if tail-recursing deeply, too [...]\")\r\n - Jan 2024: They reverted to Mergesort because it turns out that people rely on the sorting being stable, even though this is not guaranteed by the standard, and even though their Heapsort fallback won't guarantee it anyway. (https://github.com/bminor/glibc/commit/709fbd3ec3595f2d1076b4fec09a739327459288)\r\n\r\nThis means that the current libc is probably fine. But old versions may be problematic, and other implementations of the standard library may also be problematic. If anything, all of this confirms that Heapsort is a good choice, and that we should not rely on the standard library here.",
