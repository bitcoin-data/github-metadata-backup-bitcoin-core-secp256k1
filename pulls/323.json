      "body": "Perhaps I should have broken it up.  The only parts which I think are a potential maintenance burden are the module conditional functionality. Most of this patch is unrelated to the module conditional functionality. I hope you agree that moving the test only code into tests is reasonable?\n\nI was aware the rest was debatable, that is why I specifically called out the cost. I don't think the burden is _that_ great, as we'll get yelled at by the compiler.\n\nAs far as the benefit, -- here are the benefits I see:\n\nWe no longer need to suppress this standard warning, which means we'll find out if we've left actually dead code right away (a problem we've had multiple times); and people compiling the code base with alternative tool-chains that have not suppressed that warning won't get a flood of concerning warning messages that make us look like clowns :).\n\nAnother benefit is to increase code reviewability by making it easier for people to skip reviewing code they know they'll never run in production. Admittedly, with the test-only code moved there isn't much code here, so maybe this one is small. \n\nA last benefit is that not all compilers will reliably optimize out deeply nested uncalled functions. But I don't actually know how common this is, perhaps we shouldn't care about it.\n\nPerhaps an alternative would be to move the test-only code,  and set things up so that we compile without -Wno-unused-function  only when all modules are enabled.  Then at least we'll get warnings for unused code which is unrelated to module selection but avoid peppering things with conditionals.   Would you find that preferable?\n\nI really do think the unused function warning is helpful, and I'd prefer to not always be suppressing it-- it sometimes even reveals actual bugs (e.g. you meant to call F() but typo and call G() instead, leaving F() unused).\n",

It has many functions like ge_eq_ and friends that pull back the covers. I don't see any real problem with this.\n\nIf you don't want to do this.. okay, though I think it's unfortunate to have a bunch of test only code in the codebase and that it does materially increase the cost of review.\n",

      "body": "(2) Of course to an extent, tests are already breaking abstractions, because they test things at various levels. But not in the way this PR does. secp256k1_ge and secp256k1_gej are already 'exposed' types, as the type definition is part of their interface - which is fine as long as we see no need for another group implementation (which would be something that for example uses homogeneous coordinates?). Field, scalar, and num are not exposed, and the only way to inspect or mutate them is using functions from the respective module.\n\nI think we can reconsider after #290, which adds a new and incompatible num implementation. Perhaps we can restrict num's API to only support modular inverses (and perhaps Jacobi symbol), and separate out a naive bignum implementation for use in test. But maybe it makes more sense to keep num fully-fledged as well at that point, as the modinv/jacobi code may end up sharing a lot of code with it anyway.\n",
