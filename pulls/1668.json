    "body": "In the course of trying to understand the x-only ECDH benchmark results in the silent payments PR (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1519#discussion_r2006144436), I noticed that we don't have a benchmark yet for `ecmult_const_xonly`, so I added one.\r\n\r\nResults on my machine:\r\n```\r\n$ ./build/bin/bench_ecmult\r\nBenchmark                     ,    Min(us)    ,    Avg(us)    ,    Max(us)\r\n\r\necmult_gen                    ,    12.3       ,    12.6       ,    13.2\r\necmult_const                  ,    27.2       ,    28.6       ,    30.9\r\necmult_const_xonly            ,    29.3       ,    30.4       ,    32.6\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\nI was a bit surprised to see that the x-only variant is slower than the regular ecmult_const function, but on the other hand the former allows to skip pubkey deserialization (i.e. determining y with a square root calculation, which is rather expensive), so that has to be taken account for a fair comparison in use-cases like ECDH (see also benchmark commit in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1198). Having an isolated ecmult benchmark for it still seems to make sense, imho. Note that the teardown function is a bit hacky; since we don't have the parity of the x-only point multiplication results, the full point multiplication ones are calculated and the x coordinates are compared, and `bench_ecmult_teardown_helper` isn't used.",
