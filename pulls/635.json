      "body": "I don't follow your argument: The openssl tests are largely separated so although they are additional things, they don't increase complexity of other things-- their cost primarily just their maintenance, which has been fairly minimal.\r\n\r\nIf you are getting valgrind errors from openssl it means your openssl was not complied with -DPURIFY, you should go scream at your distribution to fix that-- many distributions compile their openssl with -DPURIFY.  The tests with openssl are valgrind clean for me on fedora, for example.\r\n\r\nAn argument I'd make for removing it would be that it's possible that its presence falsely causes people to believe that openssl is a dependency of the library and then causes them to use less well reviewed alternatives.  I don't think we have any evidence that this is currently happening, but I'm not sure we would.\r\n\r\nAn argument I'd make against removing it is that we have many useful randomized tests which lack a ground truth. These tests lose a lot of their testing power unless they operate as a comparison against and independent implementation. One possible alternative would be to include a tiny independent implementation (potentially uses GMP for its numbers), has it's own distinct group law (perhaps an entirely affine naive implementation).  This would be useful as it would be essentially nearly maintenance-free (GMP api is quite stable) and could plausibly be more independent than openssl (which could have some bugs in common with us). It would also generalize to more functions that we implement that openssl does not.   The downside would be that it would take a little effort to create.\r\n",
