    "body": "This PR\r\n - replaces `ull` constants by `UINT64()` constants because `ull` is strictly speaking not supported by C89. \r\n - does the same for `UINT32()` for the sake of consistency both with `UINT64()` but also in general with the `uintXX_t` types we use (if we use `uintXX_t` using the corresponding constant macros is the most natural thing to do)\r\n - makes `gen_context.c` C89 compliant. (It was not but we didn't notice because it has its own CFLAGS) \r\n\r\nPlease see the commit messages to see how to re-create the first commit. This will make reviewing this rather trivial. \r\n\r\nedit: I know this touches > 300 lines but I think it will hardly annoy any existing PRs because the lines with constants are typically not touched.",

It also removes `-Wno-overlength-strings`, which is apparently\nnot needed currently either.\n\nThe motivation for this change is compliance with C89 (#745) for ULL/LL but also\nreviewability: Even though it's not relevant in the current code, I think it's\nconfusing to use the portable uint32_t/uint64_t types but then constants of\nthe unsigned long (long) types, which differ across targets.\n\nFixes #745.",

Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",

      "body": "@sipa \r\nWell, it's true that only C >=99 requires the existence of `stdint.h`. But that does not prevent a C89 compiler from providing it. In fact, even C99 does not guarantee that `uint32_t` and `uint64_t` exist. So our working model is C89 with `uint32_t`/`uint64_t` support. That fits the wording in the README: \"Intended to be portable to any system with a C89 compiler and uint64_t support.\" (if you add the very reasonable implicit assumption that such a C compiler will also provide `uint32_t`).This initially confused me too, see the discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/568#discussion_r228730443 and https://stackoverflow.com/a/26502360/2725281.\r\n\r\nInitially we left `long long` in, probably because noone cared. (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/193). And I still think noone cares.\r\n\r\nAnother discussion is whether we want to give up the C89 requirement. If I were to start a new project, I wouldn't use C89. But here's a pragmatic view: given that made sure the entire codebase is C89 (modulo this PR), there's no reason to give this up now. It's sometimes annoying but I can live with it (and I prefer living it with over having the discussion). Things would change of course if a specific language feature not available in C89 would make the implementation of a new feature much easier for example.\r\n\r\nBut I think all of this misses the main point of this PR. I think it's simply cleaner code and the right thing(TM) to use `uint32_t` for `uint32_t` computations and `long` constants for `long` computations. If they turn out to be equivalent, fine, but everyone looking at the code needs to think about this every time.",
