    "body": "The CMake cache is global in scope. Therefore, setting the standard cache variable `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` can inadvertently affect the behavior of a parent project.\r\n\r\nConsider configuring Bitcoin Core without explicit setting `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`:\r\n```\r\n$ cmake -B build -DBUILD_KERNEL_LIB=ON\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to CMakeâ€™s documentation, this should configure `libbitcoinkernel` as `STATIC`.\r\nHowever, that's not the case:\r\n```\r\n$ cmake --build build -t libbitcoinkernel\r\n[143/143] Linking CXX shared library lib/libbitcoinkernel.so\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n1. Sets the `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` cache variable only when `libsecp256k1` is the top-level project.\r\n2. Uses the `SECP256K1_DISABLE_SHARED` cache variable only when `libsecp256k1` is included as a subproject.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the entire code block can be dropped. In that case:\r\n1. The CMake-base build system will build a static library by default.\r\n2. During integration into a parent project, the static library can be forced as demonstrated [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/minisketch/pull/75#issuecomment-2984025132).",

This becomes even more relevant with [FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html) getting more and more adoption. Not only should projects not interfere with superprojects (like setting `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` or `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` in the cache), they should also not define their own settings that already have a default in CMake. Managing a superproject is much easier when you can rely on the assumption that projects can be controlled through standard CMake variables and you don't have to remember separate names like `FOO_BUILD_SHARED`, `BAR_NO_SHARED`, `BAZ_DISABLE_STATIC`, etc.\r\n",

      "body": "> The CMake cache is global in scope\r\n\r\nSigh, this is again confusing as hell (at least to me as someone who is not a CMake expert). Let me try to organize the discussion.\r\n\r\n### What is the cleanest thing to do in a library?\r\n\r\n@hebasto:\r\n> According to CMakeâ€™s documentation, [...]\r\n\r\n@purpleKarrot:\r\n> Not only should projects not interfere with superprojects (like setting `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` or `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` in the cache) [...] \r\n\r\nThe [docs](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html) say that top-level projects should call `option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ...)`. Do we agree that, under the assumption that we are in control of both the top-level project and the subproject, this is only the second-best thing? And the best thing to do is to avoid setting this variable in the subproject? \r\n\r\n### Can we drop the entire block?\r\n\r\nI might be wrong, but wouldn't dropping the `option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ...)` here mean that this variable can't be set on the command line using `-D` (because it's not even a cache variable then)? At least, this is how I read the [docs](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html).\r\n\r\n@purpleKarrot:\r\n> they should also not define their own settings that already have a default in CMake.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that, according to the [docs](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html), `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` does not have a default.\r\n\r\n### If we can drop the entire block, should we do it?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure, but I tend to say no. I'd rather keep the default of building a shared library and accept a few lines of CMake code. If we decide to drop it, we should at least document this in the README. \r\n\r\n### Do we need `SECP256K1_DISABLE_SHARED`?\r\n\r\n>  Managing a superproject is much easier when you can rely on the assumption that projects can be controlled through standard CMake variables and you don't have to remember separate names like `FOO_BUILD_SHARED`, `BAR_NO_SHARED`, `BAZ_DISABLE_STATIC`, etc.\r\n\r\nI had to look this up. The reason why we have `SECP256K1_DISABLE_SHARED` is this:\r\n\r\n\r\n@theuni in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1230#issue-1615989593:\r\n> A new `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` option is added to match CMake convention, as well as a `SECP256K1_DISABLE_SHARED` option which overrides it. That way even projects which have `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=1` can opt-into a static libsecp in particular.\r\n\r\n@purpleKarrot \r\nAre you saying this is not necessary? (Real question, I really don't understand all of this stuff.)\r\n\r\n",

I'd rather keep the default of building a shared library and accept a few lines of CMake code. If we decide to drop it, we should at least document this in the README.\r\n\r\nI agree with that. That's why I chose the suggested approach.\r\n\r\nA shared library is a real library and should be considered as the default by-product of the build process.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> ### Do we need `SECP256K1_DISABLE_SHARED`?\r\n> \r\n> > Managing a superproject is much easier when you can rely on the assumption that projects can be controlled through standard CMake variables and you don't have to remember separate names like `FOO_BUILD_SHARED`, `BAR_NO_SHARED`, `BAZ_DISABLE_STATIC`, etc.\r\n> \r\n> I had to look this up. The reason why we have `SECP256K1_DISABLE_SHARED` is this:\r\n> \r\n> @theuni in [#1230 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1230#issue-1615989593):\r\n> \r\n> > A new `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` option is added to match CMake convention, as well as a `SECP256K1_DISABLE_SHARED` option which overrides it. That way even projects which have `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=1` can opt-into a static libsecp in particular.\r\n> \r\n> @purpleKarrot Are you saying this is not necessary? (Real question, I really don't understand all of this stuff.)\r\n\r\nUsing project-specific versions of well-known CMake variables is hard to maintain consistent. This project defines its own variable to override CMake's `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`, but omits others such as [`CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html). Specifying the library type is not the only concern when integrating into a parent project. In Bitcoin Core, we currently use an [approach](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d4bc5639829f0c98bd2faeddba9be4e8c6667875/cmake/libmultiprocess.cmake) that encapsulates the entire integration logic within a function.",

Did you change your mind when writing the post?\r\n\r\nIn my post, I show several approaches and possibilities.\r\n\r\nProject [Qux](https://github.com/purpleKarrot/qux/blob/5bdf2088b26735b2ad5fde66fb90548b53780ac6/CMakeLists.txt#L13-L15) sets `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` as an option based on `Qux_IS_TOP_LEVEL`, similar to this PR. I prefer to use project specific variables in `CMakeLists.txt` files and use generic variables like `PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL` in generic code.\r\n\r\nIn project [Bar](https://github.com/purpleKarrot/bar/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L60), I show that no such option is actually needed for building with both `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` and  `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`.\r\n\r\nIn project [Baz](https://github.com/purpleKarrot/baz/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L20), I show that even with `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` globally set to `ON`, it is possible to set it to a different value for a subproject, without there being a `QUX_DISABLE_SHARED` option.\r\n\r\nFor this PR, it means I would definitely drop the else part, and preferably the complete block of code.

I still think that defaulting to a shared library is a good idea.\r\n\r\n> Project [Qux](https://github.com/purpleKarrot/qux/blob/5bdf2088b26735b2ad5fde66fb90548b53780ac6/CMakeLists.txt#L13-L15) sets `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` as an option based on `Qux_IS_TOP_LEVEL`, similar to this PR. I prefer to use project specific variables in `CMakeLists.txt` files and use generic variables like `PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL` in generic code.\r\n\r\nOkay, I wasn't aware of [`<PROJECT-NAME>_IS_TOP_LEVEL`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/PROJECT-NAME_IS_TOP_LEVEL.html#variable:%3CPROJECT-NAME%3E_IS_TOP_LEVEL), and your convention makes sense to me.\r\n",
