The kernel one is here: \r\nhttps://github.com/openbsd/src/blob/deb51e2ea407a9dc0b2340231f789bb752bc00ed/sys/dev/rnd.c#L538\r\n\r\nInternally, it performs the same  ChaCha \"stirring\" as the libc one.  \r\n\r\nSo IIUC the entire stack is as follows. There's \r\n1. an `entropy_pool` in the kernel which is used to seed\r\n2. the kernel `arc4random_buf` which produces randomness for\r\n3. the `getentropy` syscall which seeds\r\n4. the libc `arc4random_buf` which produces randomness (and hopefully handles process forks) for\r\n5. the user without a need for a syscall\r\n\r\nI think this confirms my theory that randomness output by `getentropy` is considered \"scarcer\" and is recommended to seed software RNGs.  `arc4random_get` is then recommended for users that just want random data, but without syscalls. \r\n\r\nBy the way: The way they get rid of error statues is as follows: If libc's call to `getentropy` fails, they [try to kill the process](https://github.com/openbsd/src/blob/7c9f822481c4d6823c0a1b1741f55500f10f1341/lib/libc/crypt/arc4random.h#L32).\r\n \r\nAnother interesting question one can ask: What does Bitcoin Core do?  They [have changed to `arc4random_buf`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24238) as a result of [our previous discussion ](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/748#discussion_r524605472), even though we ended up with a different decision. /cc @thestack\r\nIt also contradicts the above theory. If `getentropy` is supposed to seed software RNGs, then Bitcoin Core should use that perhabs.\r\n\r\nOkay, what does all of this mean for us? \r\n - What we currently (`getentropy`) do is fine.\r\n - What this PR proposes (`arc4random_buf`) is what Bitcoin Core does, and it is fine. It is probably a bit more appropriate for the use case.\r\n\r\nBut currently all methods in `random.h` (except maybe on Windows) use syscalls, and it's fine to recommend this. Syscalls are more direct than relying on libc (with its fork handling etc.) and the performance penalty is not huge and certainly okay for example code... So to be honest, I'm a bit reluctant to support this PR because it seems arbitrary. It's changes good code to code which is not clearly better. \r\n\r\nI think a better approach would be to sync our code with Bitcoin Core. There could be a library/header file which is used by both, and then we don't need to maintain two versions of this mess. (Of course, requirements are bit different, e.g., getting randomness vs seeding RNGs vs just getting randomness, but in the end, none of this really matters.)",
