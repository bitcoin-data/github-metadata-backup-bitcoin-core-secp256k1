    "body": "The tests in #1698 reminded me that some functions, e.g., `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_cmp`, may call the illegal callback more than once (see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1390#discussion_r1279194655 for more context). This PR clarifies the API docs to state explicitly that this is possible. \r\n\r\nThis is the simplest solution. Any production code should crash anyway if it encounters a callback. And in debug code or in our test code, it doesn't really matter whether you see an error message once or twice.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is to provide a guarantee that the callback is called only once. But that would make our code more complex for no good reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second commit fixes a few typos, wording, and consistency. ",

      "body": "Huh, I think the guarantee we want to provide is:\r\n\"An API function called is guaranteed not to crash after the callback returns.\" \r\n\r\nThis guarantee holds no matter what the callback function is set to, which corresponds to what you called \"in any \"stage\". Now, of course, this guarantee doesn't say anything if the callback itself causes a crash (and the default callback does) because then the callback never returns, so there's no \"after the callback returns\".\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow that I've written this, I'm not sure what this actually means. In simple cases, the only thing the API function does after the callback returns is to return 0. This shouldn't crash. But there are more complex cases: \r\n - Some functions try to read more arguments from memory, e.g., `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_cmp` tries to read the memory at `pubkey1` even after an invalid `pubkey0` triggered the callback. This may crash if `pubkey1` points to an invalid memory region.       \r\n - Some functions write to their output arguments after the callback has returned (see #1736 for another rabbit hole...).\r\n\r\nPerhaps what we should want to say here is something like this: \"An API function called is guaranteed not to crash after the callback returns (unless the crash is unrelated to the violation that triggered the callback)\". But this is imprecise and ugly.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should drop this sentence entirely. It creates more confusion than it resolves. What about this?\r\n\r\n \"Should the callback return, the return value and output arguments of the API function call are undefined. Moreover, the same API call may trigger the callback again in this case.\"\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nNote that all of this is about API guarantees, so the audience is API users. As a result, \"debug stage\" means \"debug stage of a program using libsecp256k1\". (And as a side remark, note that the callbacks can be set at runtime, so strictly speaking, this is not (necessarily) about debug vs. release *builds*.) So if you develop a program (an application or another library) that uses the libsecp256k1 API, you may want to set a callback that does not crash for debugging purposes. I'm not entirely sure how useful this functionality is to API users, but this is what the docs here describe.  \r\n\r\nIn practice, where this is useful is exactly in our internal tests, as you correctly point out. But what I'm trying to say is that these are our internal tests, where we may do everything because we control the implementation of the API functions. So we could also have an internal way of setting a counting callback that is not exposed through the public API.\r\n\r\nIf you ask me, the main purpose of setting callback functions is that you can control *how* the library crashes in production code. Maybe in your application, you don't want `abort()` but a more graceful termination. Or you can't use the default callback because it writes an error message to `stdout` but you don't have `stdout` because you're developing for a hardware wallet. (In the latter case, setting callbacks at runtime won't help you because the program won't compile in the first place. We've added [compile-time overrides](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/595) for this case.)\r\n\r\nAnd on a last note, I don't think all of this is optimally designed. I believe we'd do some things differently if we had a chance to start from scratch.   ",
