    "body": "Currently CHECK is used only in test and bench mark files except for one usage in `ecmult_impl.h`.\r\n\r\nWe would like to move the definition of CHECK out of `util.h` so that `util.h` no longer has a hard dependency on `stdio.h`.\r\n\r\nDone as part of an effort to allow secp256k1 to be compiled to WASM as part of `rust-secp256k1`.\r\n\r\n### Note to reviewers\r\n\r\nPlease review carefully, I don't actually know if this patch is correct. Done while working on #1095. I'm happy to make any changes both in concept and execution - I'm super rusty at C programming.\r\n\r\ncc real-or-random ",

Of course, this particular piece of code is simple enough so that it doesn't really matter. But this seems to be a clean approach whenever we have some extra code in a #ifdef VERIFY block. ",
