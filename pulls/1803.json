    "body": "## Motivation\n\nWhen building with CMake and running `ctime_tests`, users see a message suggesting `libtool`, which is Autotools-specific:\n\n### Before\n```\n$ ./build/bin/ctime_tests\nThis test can only usefully be run inside valgrind because it was not compiled under msan.\nUsage: libtool --mode=execute valgrind ./ctime_tests\n```\n\nThis is confusing for CMake users since they don't have libtool. Reported in #1697.\n\n## Solution\n\nFollowing the approach in #1778, replace the build-system-specific command with a pointer to README.md and document both methods there.\n\n### After\n```\n$ ./build/bin/ctime_tests\nThis test can only usefully be run inside valgrind because it was not compiled under msan.\nSee README.md for usage instructions.\n```\n\nThe README now includes instructions for both build systems.\n\nFixes #1697",
