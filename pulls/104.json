It adds a _lot_ of complexity. Really I think there should be no hint of autoconf in the public header, or at least there should be a good reason for it.\n\nWRT the warnings, I don't have as much of an opinion about testing them one at a time... I intentionally didn't to avoid slowing down ./configure. The most important thing is that they're enabled for developers/maintainers of the library.  (Usually heavy warnings for regular users are slightly problematic, e.g. when clang adds a (potenitally misguided) proflatic precidence/parrens warnings, and you end up with users \"worried\" that something is wrong with the library... but they're tolerable just because you will get some important warnings from users on weird platforms.)\n",
