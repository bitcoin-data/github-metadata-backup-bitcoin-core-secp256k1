Some benchmarks take much longer than others, so it probably makes sense to run fewer iters for these.\r\n\r\n>  [x]  remove `min` and `max` statistics in favor of simpler approach with just `avg`.\r\n\r\nI think `min` and `max` are useful. For constant-time code, you can also compare `min`. And `max` gives you an idea if there were fluctuations or not.\r\n\r\n>  [x]  remove needless fixed point conversion in favor of simpler floating point divisions.\r\n\r\nWell, okay, that has a history; see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/689. It's debatable if it makes sense to avoid floating point math, but as long as it doesn't get in your way here, it's a cool thing to keep it. :D ",
