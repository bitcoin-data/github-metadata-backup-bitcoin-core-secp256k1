    "body": "- Builds on top of https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1/pull/41 (Co-Z arithmetic for precomputation).\n- Instead of inversion, scales all precomp A points to the same Z (usually != 1).\n- Store the precomp A as affine by discarding the z coordinate (whilst noting the single Z value for later), which is equivalent to taking them as affine points on an isogenous curve.\n- In secp256k1_ecmult, we treat the accumulator (\"r\") as operating on this isogenous curve.\n- Doubling formula needs no changes, adding of precomp A points is a simple _gej_add_ge_var.\n- G precomp remains the same, but each add of these requires an extra 1M to bring the accumulator temporarily back to the \"default isogeny\". For simplicity here I've modified _gej_add_ge_var to support this.\n- The z value of the final result needs to be scaled (1M) also.\n- Optimal at WINDOW_A=5.\n\nAnyway, the upshot of this is an ~5% performance improvement for bench_verify (64bit, endo=yes), over and above the Co-Z precomputation itself, so >8% total vs master. Rough math suggests it's saving ~116M vs the Co-Z arithmetic PR, which appears to make any inversion approach obsolete.\n\nQuestions welcome, as I'm not sure how to explain this in a straight-forward way (as far as I know this is a novel idea). I guess it's important to understand why the isogeny works out so neatly; it's a rather nice property of secp256k1 that stems from it having a==0 in the curve equation; otherwise, operating on an isogenous curve would require changes to the doubling formula. I recommend e.g. http://joye.site88.net/papers/TJ10coordblind.pdf, where this is discussed in the context of blinding (which reminds me I was meaning to PR a demo of that), albeit the a==0 case is not explicitly called out. It may be easier just to think of it as playing games with the z values...\n\nEDIT: I'll leave it as I wrote it, but I think the above should be talking about isomorphisms rather than isogenies.\n",

I had the z-ratio trick and the isomorphism stuff in mind for a while, and yesterday it just gelled for me. I wasn't quite sure how it would work out , but I coded it up and... 1M per G add? Awesome, indeed.\n\nI actually now think it will work fine for a!=0 curves too, using \"modified Jacobian\" coordinates to avoid increasing the cost of doubling.\n\nWhy not both scalar and point blinding? Simple point blinding amounts to just an extra 2M per scalar mult, assuming the G precomp points have been moved to some random curve isomorphism in setup.\n",

      "body": "FYI, I managed to apply this same technique to a P-521 random-base-mult implementation (http://indigo.ie/~mscott/ws521.cpp), with a similar ~8% performance boost. That curve has a==-3, which has to be scaled for the isomorphism, so to retain doubling performance (3M+5S) the formula has to be changed to a modified-Jacobian scheme. The adds (104) then cost 7M+6S instead of 11M+5S. This saving is offset by (4M+S) per precomputed point (15) to make them \"co-Z\".\n\nSo we can tentatively conclude that this is applicable to any short Weierstrass form curve, with (only) a==0 being particularly efficient. I don't know enough about other curve forms to comment yet.\n\nThe question arises whether the scheme can still be used for general (aP + bQ + cR + ...), and indeed I see no fundamental obstacle, just an extra few steps involved in the precomputation to arrange for all precomp-tables to be globally co-Z.\n",
