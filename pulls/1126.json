    "body": " - Documents the changes made to contexts that came with the transition to only static tables\r\n - Rename the static context\r\n - Expose the self tests for users of the static context\r\n\r\nThese are user-visible changes, so this is also a testbed for the changelog. I refrained from linking to the PR as the template proposed for multiple reasons:\r\n - Including the PR title is not in line with the suggestions in https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/ What they do instead is really just describe what parts in the API have changed, and I tend to agree that this is better for the user. The PR title can be rather technical or saying not too much, and a PR can correspond to multiple changes (for example this PR).\r\n - I'd be open to Include a link to the PR but I feel it's a little bit annoying because you get the PR number only after creating the PR... Also I think the changelog is addressed to our users, not our devs. It should be just a log of user-visible changes (syntax and visible API behavior), so we anyway shouldn't include every PR. \r\n\r\nA normal strategy would be to create a release first, then make the API changes, but in this case, this would be somewhat confusing. The important thing here is the changes made to context flags and these are already for quite some time, so it makes sense to document these even for the initial release.",

So what does \"initialized for signing mean\"? Is it just the static context that doesn't have it, while all others do? Or is it somehow still linked to the flags passed at creation time, despite those being deprecated?\r\n\r\n(just playing the devil's advocate here, trying to show the reasoning someone going through the .h files may follow)",

      "body": "> @real-or-random Actually, in what way is the static context not usable for signing operations?\r\n\r\nOh, we could make it usable for signing. (At the moment the relevant parts of the object are simply not initialized but that will be easy to fix, in particular now that https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1120 has been merged.)\r\n\r\nThe actual question is whether we would like to make it usable for signing. The static context cannot be randomized, so you'll never get protection by random blinding. I think allowing signing would not be unreasonable (and simplify the API and the docs a lot). But I'm not sure if we want to encourage this mode of usage. I tend to the opposite: Now that dynamic context creation is fast and doesn't need a lot of memory, we should encourage people to use that route.\r\n\r\nWith the current API, you could argue that anyway a lot of users are probably never adding randomness, so it won't make a lot of difference. But I think when evaluating this, we should keep in mind that a future context API will hopefully make it easier to randomize, e.g., context creation should directly accept a seed, and some of the (standard) signing API calls should rerandomize the context etc...  \r\n\r\n(This was one of the questions in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/988#issuecomment-938650194, and there I decided to not change the API because we could always do it later.)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

You are not forced to call `context_randomize` but you don't get a convenience bonus from the static context.\r\n\r\nedit: I can try to rewrite this with better names and make sure the static context is a special case.

If we allow signing with static contexts, the SIGN flag lost its meaning entirely since all contexts are SIGN contexts.

I still lean towards disallowing secret key ops with the static context because allowing it would create an incentive to skip randomization:  \r\n\r\n>> On the one hand, yes, I think we do want to encourage using properly-(re)randomized signing contexts to get maximal blinding protection. But on the other hand, I also don't think we should go as far as saying that one cannot use the signing API without forcing randomization;\r\n\r\n> Okay, then the current API does exactly this. You are not forced to call `context_randomize` but you don't get a convenience bonus from the static context.",

          "body": "On top of #1126.\r\n\r\nThis prototypes one possible approach to solve #1095 by implementing the approach described in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1095#issuecomment-1303537678:\r\n\r\n> [...] reorganize headers such that most functions are in some header like `secp256k1_main.h`, which is then included from `secp256k1.h` (with only malloc functions like `secp256k1_context_create()`) and `secp256k1_preallocated.h` (with their prealloc counterparts). Then the user could easily choose between the two interfaces by including either `secp256k1.h` or `secp256k1_preallocated.h`\r\n\r\nNow that I've been working on this, I don't like this approach for various reasons:\r\n - The functions and docs are really cluttered in multiple files.\r\n     - In particular, the context stuff: Creation, cloning, destruction is in `secp256k1_(preallocated).h`, whereas the static context, flags, randomization, and callbacks are in `secp256k1_main.h`. This is hard to grasp for new users and also add confusion for users who don't need the preallocated interface.\r\n     - In general, there's no canonical \"primary\" header anymore. Where do you put general docs that belong to the library as a whole (e.g., the comment that explains the rules of thumb for the order of arguments in API calls)? \r\n  - We need to remove the `#include \"secp256k1.h\"` from the module headers such as `secp256k1_ecdh.h` (because otherwise you couldn't include the module header if you want only the prealloc interface). This means that\r\n     -  this PR is not perfectly backwards-compatible: it will break compilation for  users who include currently only `secp256k1_ecdh.h` and not `secp256k1_ecdh.h`.\r\n     - the dependencies between the header files are not naturally expressed by the #includes\r\n     - you need to include the header files in the right order, i.e., first `secp256k1_(preallocated).h` and then `secp256k1_ecdh.h` because the latter needs the declaration of `secp256k1_context` (and we couldn't even repeat that declaration somewhere to workaround this problem: Compiler tells us `warning: redefinition of typedef 'secp256k1_context' is a C11 feature`...)\r\n\r\nSo I think this PR would indeed make it possible to use only the prealloc interface, but it makes the life harder for everyone, in particular for normal users who have malloc and don't even care about prealloc. I think we should switch to an approach with a macro like `PREALLOC_INTERFACE_ONLY` that you need to set before including `secp256k1.h` (and when compiling the library itself) and that will remove all the functions that depend on malloc.  But please tell me if you disagree. \r\n",

      "body": "Here's something that came up when reviewing #1168, where @jonasnick changes the tests to use `secp256k1_context_create(SECP256K1_CONTEXT_DECLASSIFY)` \r\n\r\nI was wondering if this should be `SECP256K1_CONTEXT_DEFAULT | SECP256K1_CONTEXT_DECLASSIFY`? I mean... it won't matter for the tests. But assume we'll add a new flag `SECP256K1_CONTEXT_FANCY_FEATURE`?\r\n\r\nSo far, the flags have really been bitflags, so that you can bitwise-OR them.  And so far, `SECP256K1_CONTEXT_NONE` has been the neutral element in this algebraic group.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, if you want fancy features, should you ask for `SECP256K1_CONTEXT_DEFAULT | SECP256K1_CONTEXT_FANCY_FEATURE`? Or just `SECP256K1_CONTEXT_FANCY_FEATURE` (which has a different value since `SECP256K1_CONTEXT_DEFAULT != SECP256K1_FLAGS_TYPE_CONTEXT` -- the \"SIGN bit\" `(1 << 9)` is set).\r\n\r\nI think in the end it won't really matter -- as long as we promise to ignore the value of the \"SIGN bit\".\r\n\r\n But I wonder:\r\n   - Should DEFAULT in fact be an alias to (the existing value of) NONE? I didn't do that due to ABI compatibility: If the user has a new header but an old binary, then they'll get an actual NONE context... I'm not sure if this matters at all but making DEFAULT an alias to SIGN seems slightly cleaner.\r\n   - Does \"DEFAULT\" make sufficiently clear that it is supposed to be the neutral element of a group (which it is if we'll ignore the value of the SIGN bit)? Maybe NONE expressed this better, and now I realize that @jonasnick suggested this above: \"Therefore, we could deprecate all flags except NONE, which would be the default flag that we'd most likely choose if we started with a clean slate. But effectively it's just a different name.\"\r\n\r\nSo now that I've been writing this, I think slightly cleaner solution will be to\r\n - set the SIGN bit with value 1 as part of SECP256K1_FLAGS_TYPE_CONTEXT instead (just to ensure the mentioned ABI compatibility)\r\n - call the one non-deprecated flag NONE (instead of DEFAULT) and set no \"feature\" bits at all. \r\n\r\nThis is indeed a new clean slate. And it reserves the DEFAULT name flag for future use. (Maybe in the future, we want introduce a feature that should be enabled by \"default\", and we could rather use \"DEFAULT\" to mean \"give me whatever the maintainers think should be the default\" instead of \"enable no features\".) \r\n\r\nOpinions? I'll think I'll make that change this if noone objects.",

If we anyway forbid cloning the static context, you should never a way to randomize a copy of the static context. (You need a copy because the static context itself is not writable.

I omitted this because it's perhaps obvious, it adds clutter everywhere, and confuses the user more than it helps: cloning the static context is a pretty obscure operation. (Is there any valid use case even?) I think we could in fact disallow this operation. I doubt this hurts anyone, and it would arguably make the API docs even simpler. But I didn't add this to this PR because it would technically be a backward incompatible change, and its of limited use: We cannot prevent the user from simply copying the memory, e.g., using memcpy.   \r\n\r\nNow that you bring this up, what we could do is to add a further comment to the docs of `_context_clone` or the docs of the static context? I think would be the best way to document that the restrictions apply also to clones. Do you want me to do this?",

It is possible to call this function more than once on\n+ * the same context, and doing so before every few computations involving secret\n+ * keys is recommended as a defense-in-depth measure.\n+ *\n+ * Currently, the random seed is mainly used for blinding multiplications of a\n+ * secret scalar with the elliptic curve base point. Multiplications of this\n+ * kind are performed by exactly those API functions which are documented to\n+ * require a context that is not the secp256k1_context_static.
