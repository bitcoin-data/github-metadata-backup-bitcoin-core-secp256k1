I think it can be optimized out if the compiler can prove that no other code will read it. That seems unlikely, as the call is an API call. But if the compiler can prove this, then it's indeed fine to optimize it out? Or are you saying we should make absolutely sure that it's cleared out, even if the caller won't read it? Perhaps.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> Why do you think it can be optimized out? I think it can be optimized out if the compiler can prove that no other code will read it. That seems unlikely, as the call is an API call.\r\n\r\nI agree that it's unlikely to be optimized out, and I confirmed on my setup (arm64 macOS Clang 17.0.0) that even with -O3 and full LTO that it wasn't. However, that's not guaranteed since it's possible a different compiler (or later version) can prove no later reads, so I figured it's just best practice to use a wiper much less likely to be DSE'd. \r\n\r\n> But if the compiler can prove this, then it's indeed fine to optimize it out? Or are you saying we should make absolutely sure that it's cleared out, even if the caller won't read it? \r\n\r\nThe latter. If they assumed the callee wiped the memory (as is [promised](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/03fb60ad2e38ae9415e64bf5ba523a10100d4c3c/include/secp256k1_musig.h#L484-L486) in the API comment), they might not bother themselves and it could be left in caller memory.\r\n",

      "body": "I agree it's better to prevent the compiler from optimizing out that store. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this PR adds another code smell. I know it's me who suggested `secp256k1_memclear` above. In the rest of the code base, we use `secp256k1_memclear` to nuke memory contents. This is true here as well, but here we want the additional guarantee that the memory is overwritten by *zero bytes*. That fits the current implementation but not the documented contract of `secp256k1_memclear`. An implementation that overwrites everything with 0x42 is equally correct. We simply picked 0x00 because it appears to be faster. I doubt that will change in the future, but I still think we should avoid the contract violation.\r\n\r\n### What could we do instead?\r\nWe could use `secp256k1_memclear` but rename `secp256k1_memclear` to `secp256k1_memzero` and change its docs to guarantee it writes zeros. There's nothing wrong with adding that guarantee, but I don't think the result will be much cleaner if we only do this. We use `SECP256K1_CHECKMEM_UNDEFINE` inside this function for a reason. If the goal is to nuke a buffer, then there should be no legitimate reason to read the buffer again (as @jonasnick pointed out above). So nuking and zeroing are different concerns, and neither is a strict subset of the other. What we want in this specific case of zeroing the secnonce is simply both.\r\n\r\nWe could instead call `secp256k1_memzero` (after renaming) and then call `SECP256K1_CHECKMEM_DEFINE`. That's totally fine, and that's my suggestion. But we really should call `SECP256K1_CHECKMEM_DEFINE` inside the function and not only in the tests. If we provide the API guarantee that the secnonce is zeroed, then it's totally legitimate that the API user reads (if only in a test). And we don't want the user to get a Valgrind false positive when doing that!\r\n\r\nWe could also call `secp256k1_memclear` and then `memset(..., 0, ...)`. That's also good. It may be a performance hit, but in any case a tiny one. (On Linux, the compiler should not be able to remove the second `memset` due to the memory barrier. But I wouldn't care too much.)\r\n\r\n\r\nedit: @john-moffett Sorry that this PR escalated quickly given that the issue is seemingly simple...",

      "body": "> An alternative to your suggestion is to have both a `memclear` and `memzero` function, where the latter differs from the former by guaranteeing that the memory is overwritten with 0s and not calling `CHECKMEM_UNDEFINE`\r\n\r\nOk, sure, that's another option. Concept ACK .\r\n\r\nI was considering that option too, but I didn't mention it because I had the feeling that the existence of two functions may confuse future devs. But now that I think about it, I guess it's fine. Perhaps then we can make it clear from the naming that both variants protect against optimization, e.g., by adding an `_explicit` (inspired by `memzero_explicit` in the Linux kernel) or `_secure` suffix.\r\n\r\n> But is there any value in just reusing `memczero` and making it non-elidable in the same way `memclear` is (though `SecureZeroMemory` would have to be replaced with something suitable for conditional erase)?\r\n\r\n> As a separate matter, is it worth making `memczero` non-elidable anyway? Perhaps not given its current usage.\r\n\r\nThat's an interesting point you raise.\r\n\r\nRegarding its usage: I think it was initially introduced to clear the `pubkey` when the secret key is invalid, but without leaking the fact that it is. But protecting the fact that it is already \"above and beyond\" and just defense-in-depth. And perhaps a bit questionable, though it won't hurt. \r\n\r\nBut all its three usages in `musig/session_impl.h` (two of them wrapped by `_musig_secnonce_invalidate`) are for clearing secrets, and this is where it gets interesting. In this case, I believe there's a tension here between protecting against two kinds of side-channels, namely timing/memory access (protecting the secrecy of the `flag`) vs. someone stealing secrets from a memory dump such as a crash dump (protecting the secrecy of the memory region). \r\n\r\nHow would a function look like that is both non-elidable and protects the `flag`? I have no idea, exactly due to platform-specific APIs such as `SecureZeroMemory`. That's the right way(TM) to clear memory on Windows, and I'm not at all convinced that it's a good idea to replace it, e.g., by a handrolled version. Or by falling back to the \"volatile\" function pointer trick, which is supposed to be portable, but who knows what compilers will do in the future and what they will do when they encounter \"volatile\", which pretty much has implementation-defined semantics. The nice thing about `SecureMemoryZero` is really that we get a guarantee from MSVC not to elide it. So I think `memczero` should stay entirely separate from `memclear` and `memzero`, at least for now.\r\n\r\nSo if we can't have the best of both worlds, we need to decide what protection we want. Currently, whenever we use `memczero`, we implicitly favor the protection of the flag, and this seems to be a questionable choice for its usages in `musig/session_impl.h` (or in general when clearing out secrets). I'd much rather give the attacker that one bit whether the secret key was invalid vs. taking the risk to keep the entire secnonce (or the entire nonce seed) somewhere on the stack. If we believe that this PR is a good idea, i.e., the clearing of the secnonce should better be non-elidable, then I think we should arrive at the same conclusion for the other three uses. And in particular this use here, where the `flag` is a constant anyway: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/03fb60ad2e38ae9415e64bf5ba523a10100d4c3c/src/modules/musig/session_impl.h#L485\r\n\r\nBut this may be a larger discussion, and I'd like to hear @jonasnick's opinion on it. So my suggestion is to leave `memczero` for a follow-up PR. This PR here could then just add `memzero` as a variant of `memclear`, perhaps add a suffix to the names, and use it in `_musig_partial_sign`.",
