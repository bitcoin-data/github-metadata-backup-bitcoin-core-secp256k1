      "body": "> You mean monotonically? If we follow the algorithm in [gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html), then it's easy to see that _current_ - _age_ will increase monotonically (if I'm not mistaken).\r\n\r\nThough I agree it can be strange due to setting `age = 0` in the last step. That means if we have a backwards-incompatible change (e.g., interface removed), we could have a hop from\r\n * `2:5:2` -> `0.2.5`  to \r\n * `3:0:0` -> `3.0.0`.\r\n\r\nSo you skip over 1.x and 2.x entirely... I guess that's fine, just not \"elegant\". I'm pretty sure in that case one could also reset `current` to `1`, so one would have `1:0:0` -> `1.0.0`. For example, the rules in https://autotools.info/libtool/version.html are a little different and never set `age` to 0.... (It's all a huge mess... :shrug: )\r\n\r\n\r\nThis uses the translation for Linux (without the \"+1\" for Mac OS). See [the libtool source](https://github.com/autotools-mirror/libtool/blob/6132006b5fb6b95f31c30a972fbb829f93e1878b/build-aux/ltmain.in#L7001) for the ugly details.\r\n\r\nI'm somewhat concerned that the first release commits us to this strange libtool convention with `current`, `revision`, `age` (which apparently is only used in libtool and no other build system). But on the other hand, I don't think there's a way to avoid this unless (we want to get rid of libtool as our main build system). I guess we need to apply tricks, e.g., in CMake to match libtool behavior, but AFAIU, you did this already in the CMake PR (I also found this https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION.html by the way). I guess we'd need to test it on multiple platforms.   \r\n",

But after rereading the release process, I see two potential shortcomings:\r\n\r\n- The version on the master branch is `MAJOR.MINOR.0-pre`. So the patch version is always 0 on master, even if we've actually released patches for `MAJOR.MINOR`. This might indicate at first glance that master somehow contains an older version. To avoid this and mark the unreleased version more clearly, we could use patch version 99 for the master branch.\r\n- The release process currently does not describe when to replace the dummy date of the release in master. And doing this would be an extra step/PR. Maybe it's easier - at least for now - to avoid the dummy date entirely by using the current date as the release date in the PR to master. This may mean that that date needs to be updated multiple times while the release PR is not merged.\r\n",

And this is true even for the first maintenance release. So a more general process: is\r\n - Create a branch from the tag, bump PATCH+1 on this branch and set Release = false\r\n - (Work on the branch)\r\n - Open a PR that creates the release (\"prepare\" commit + second commit that bumps PATCH+1) again.\r\n\r\nBut nothing in the current version is wrong, and this is just for maintenance releases. So we can adjust a bit once we make such a release.",

(And this was not a problem with the previous approach...)\r\n\r\n> Don't care about it\r\n\r\n Well we anyway need to open the PR for the right date to get the release date right... So yeah, this is doable but it still seems error-prone. (And releases are the one thing where we don't want to make mistakes, because we cannot correct them without another release.)\r\n\r\n> Use two separate PRs, and tag the merge-commit of the first.\r\n\r\nOk, that works. I tried to avoid two PRs but ok.  What if we have a single PR, merge that locally with the merge tool, tag the merge, let the merging maintainer add the \"bump after release\" commit manually, and then push the result. That saves the second PR and having that one commit with PR is harmless. (And if there's a problem with the \"bump after release\" commit, then we can just fix it on master and it won't affect the release.) \r\n\r\n> Use two commits (or at least the first one) that's not part of a PR, but just immediately pushed by a maintainer to the master branch.\r\n\r\nIs that what I just wrote above? I'm not sure. You say at least the first commit should be manual and not part of the PR, and I don't see how that would work. (In my suggestion, the *second* commit is done manually.)\r\n",

Therefore, we have two (maybe significantly) different states of the repo that are marked as `IS_RELEASE`. Another problem with this approach is that the repo is locked after the first PR until the second commit lands in the repo (unless you ignore `IS_RELEASE` and `VERSION_PATCH` for a while).\r\n\r\nAnother approach is that we revert the release process back to a version where we set the patch version of master to `99` and branch off from before we set `IS_RELEASE` which is preserved [here](https://github.com/jonasnick/secp256k1/blob/initial-release-backup2/doc/release-process.md).

The bug was merged in master already. Master at this point is on its way to become `v3.2.0` or `v4.0.0`. A `v3.1.1` happens to be necessary to fix the bug however. I'd say the only required step is the creation of a `3.1` branch, branching off the `v3.1.0` merge commit, and adding the release notes relevant for `v3.1.1` *there*. Having that `Prepare for v3.1.1` strikes me as unnecessary and confusing in master because master has changes that won't be in `v3.1.1`, though it may be useful to at the same time clean up the release notes related to the bug in master too, if needed.",

So far I held the belief that it's a good thing to treat the changelog more like a \"global\" thing that lists all releases (regular and maintenance across branches).

After the PR is merged,\n-   * if this is **not** a patch release, create a release branch with name `MAJOR.MINOR`.\n-     Make sure that the branch contains the right commits.\n-     Create commit on the release branch that sets `_PKG_VERSION_IS_RELEASE` in `configure.ac` to `true`.\n-   * if this **is** a patch release, open a pull request with the bugfixes to the `MAJOR.MINOR` branch.\n-     Also include the release note commit bump `_PKG_VERSION_BUILD` and `_LIB_VERSIONS_*` in `configure.ac`.\n-4. Tag the commit with `git tag -s vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.\n-5. Push branch and tag with `git push origin --tags`.\n-6. Create a new GitHub release with a link to the corresponding entry in `doc/CHANGELOG.md`.\n+This document outlines the process for releasing versions of the form `$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH`.\n+\n+We distinguish between two types of releases: *regular* and *maintenance* releases.\n+Regular releases are releases of a new major or minor version as well as patches of the most recent release.\n+Maintenance releases, on the other hand, are required for patches of older releases.\n+\n+You should coordinate with the other maintainers on the release date, if possible.\n+This date will be part of the release entry in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) and it should match the dates of the remaining steps in the release process (including the date of the tag and the GitHub release).\n+It is best if the maintainers are present during the release, so they can help ensure that the process is followed correctly and, in the case of a regular release, they are aware that they should not modify the master branch between merging the PR in step 1 and the PR in step 3.\n+\n+This process also assumes that there will be no minor releases for old major releases.\n+\n+## Regular release\n+\n+1. Open a PR to the master branch with a commit (using message `\"release: prepare for $MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH\"`, for example) that\n+       * adds release notes to [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) (make sure to include an entry for `### ABI Compatibility`) and\n+       * updates `_PKG_VERSION_*`, `_LIB_VERSION_*`, and sets `_PKG_VERSION_IS_RELEASE` to `true` in `configure.ac`.\n+2. After the PR is merged, tag the commit and push it:\n+   ```\n+   RELEASE_COMMIT=<merge commit of step 1>\n+   git tag -s v$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH -m \"libsecp256k1 $MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH\" $RELEASE_COMMIT\n+   git push git@github.com:bitcoin-core/secp256k1.git v$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH\n+   ```\n+3. Open a PR to the master branch with a commit (using message `\"release: bump version after $MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH\"`, for example) that sets `_PKG_VERSION_IS_RELEASE` to `false` and `_PKG_VERSION_PATCH` to `$PATCH + 1` and increases `_LIB_VERSION_REVISION`.\n+  * If other maintainers are not present to approve the PR, it can be merged without ACKs.\n+4. Create a new GitHub release with a link to the corresponding entry in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).\n+\n+## Maintenance release\n+\n+Note that bugfixes only need to be backported to releases for which no compatible release without the bug exists.\n+\n+1. Open PR to the master branch that includes a commit (with commit message `\"release: prepare for $MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH\"`, for example) that adds release notes to [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).",
