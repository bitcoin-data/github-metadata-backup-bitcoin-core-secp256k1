      "message": "Adds a declassify operation to aid constant-time analysis.\n\nECDSA signing has a retry loop for the exceptionally unlikely case\n that S==0.  S is not a secret at this point and this case is so\n rare that it will never be observed but branching on it will trip\n up tools analysing if the code is constant time with respect to\n secrets.\n\nDerandomized ECDSA can also loop on k being zero or overflowing,\n and while k is a secret these cases are too rare (1:2^255) to\n ever observe and are also of no concern.\n\nThis adds a function for marking memory as no-longer-secret and\n sets it up for use with the valgrind memcheck constant-time\n test.",

In `secp256k1_ecdsa_sig_sign` the code makes the following recommendation:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/96d8ccbd16090551aa003bfa4acd108b0496cb89/src/ecdsa_impl.h#L285-L293\r\n\r\nHowever, these two conditions are not actually checked before calling. The main call doesn't:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/96d8ccbd16090551aa003bfa4acd108b0496cb89/src/secp256k1.c#L491-L510\r\n\r\nNote that `sigr` is the nonce (R)'s x coordinate reduced modulo q as a scalar. The caller is only checking properties of the secret nonce not `sigr` (it doesn't even compute the point for R). Maybe this code was meant to check the secret nonce that's passed in instead?\r\n\r\nThere doesn't seem to be any problem with `sigr` overlfowing (the verification algorithm actually accounts for this possibility by adding the curve order to `sigr` if it doesn't work the first time!). `sigr` being 0 is a problem but the probability of this happening is so low I wouldn't bother accounting for it. I think this comment and VERIFY_CHECKS can be removed.\r\n\r\nMore generally there doesn't seem to be a problem with the secret nonce overflowing either but the while loop in the caller enforces that and that it's not 0.\r\n",

I consider the return values not agreeing with the docs to be a pretty serious bug, and it's unfortunate that there aren't tests for cases where the nonce function induces it.  That said, the noncefp docs specify that the return is 0 or 1 too: \" * Returns: 1 if a nonce was successfully generated. 0 will cause signing to fail.\"",

The order of secp256k1 is fortunately such that the bias would not actually be a problem, though this isn't the case for many other curves.  Personally, if I were auditing an someone elses crypto code and saw it producing biased nonces like that I would instant fail the audit and not bother looking at anything else because the software was clearly written people by people who didn't notice or didn't heed the pile of dead bodies of their forebearers that thought leaving nonces a little biased was okay.\r\n\r\nThere isn't much point in cmoving there because the loop must run again that case, making the function take a non-constant time. So the cmov would just be constant time theatre with no improvement. It would _still_ have to be declassified too,  since constant time analysis would notice the loop being conditioned on it-- so the cmov would be just pure theater, not actually improve the constant timeness and just adding code.\r\n",

Perhaps it's easiest to call `secp256k1_fe_clear` on `s` before the set_b32?",

It would totally be fine to not !! here with the current code,  but then later we go and refactor something and the boolean test gets turned into an ==1 or used in an arithmetic expression and it works incorrectly.\r\n\r\nSo in general, I usually tend to boolenize  a boolean variable unless its never used outside of a single scope, or in some performance critical inner loop where the single test opcode might actually matter.  Though for flags the more ordinary way to booleanize is (flags & flag) == flag.",
