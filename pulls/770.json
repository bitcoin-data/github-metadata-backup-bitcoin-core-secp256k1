On novena, the latest supported OS is debian jessie.  The situation for toolchains you might find setup for hardware wallets and whatnot isn't that different a story.\r\n\r\nIf there is a choice between being fast on older compilers or new, sure pick new. Or between something much harder to maintain and a small slowdown on older compilers, sure. Bit 9% is pretty big, and a byteswap macro is about as idiomatic as you get. \r\n\r\nSmall embedded devices don't usually have hashing hardware so 702 doesn't really apply,  unless you think that it's okay to just provide objectively worse stuff because the user can fix this libraries mistakes?\r\n\r\nBesides, it appears to be a similar similar story elsewhere, if less dramatic.

      "body": "@gmaxwell You mentioned endian.h but this seems to be a portability mess, too. Or which header do you refer to?\r\n\r\nHere's another idea: What about sticking to autoconf but also let it define a macro if it figures out little-endian. Then we can  #error out at least (or try `__BYTE_ORDER__` as a fallback, which is at least available on GCC/clang, and #error if that fails too). That's not very ergonomic but at least it errs on the side of caution, whereas we currently simply assume LE if autoconf was not used. Creating wrong hashes could end up terribly, e.g., if you create a schnorr sig with a user-specified nonce function, you could end up signing different hashes with the same nonce.  \r\n\r\nFor enhanced safety, we could even add a cheap check in the context creation that checks at runtime if the endianness matches what it thinks it has been compiled for. Reminds me of my suggestion in #702.",
