    "body": "This is an attempt at a simple release process. Fixes #856. To keep it simple, there is no concept of release candidates for now.\r\n\r\nThe release version is determined by semantic versioning of the API. Since it does not seem to be a lot of work, it is proper to also version the ABI with the libtool versioning system. This versioning scheme (semver API, libtool versioning ABI) follows the suggestion in the [autotools mythbusters](https://autotools.io/libtool/version.html).\r\n\r\nExperimental modules are a bit of a headache, as expected. This release process suggests to treat any change in experimental modules as backwards compatible. That way, users of stable modules are not bothered by frequent non-backwards compatible releases. But a downside is that one must not use experimental modules in shared libraries (which should be mentioned in the README?). It would be nice if we could make the schnorrsig module stable in the not too distant future (see also #817).\r\n",

      "body": "Another question (not necessarily something to be explicitly explained in the release process here, but still something that isn't currently clear to me): what branches structure are the release branches going to use? Possibilities:\r\n* All release branches branch off master, and thus there is no (clean) way to create a `x.y.(z+1)` after `x.(y+1).z` has been released.\r\n* The branch for `x.(y+1).0` branches off the `x.y.0` branch; the branch for `x.y.(z+1)` branches off the `x.y.z` one. Open questions with this:\r\n  * How to obtain monotonically increasing library \"revision\" value in the presence of branches?\r\n  * When creating a new branch by forking an already-released branch, would that imply resetting the IS_RELEASE variable? Or do we create the fork at the last commit before the one that sets the IS_RELEASE variable?",

      "body": "@jonasnick Yes, I meant including the actual rules for incrementing the library version somewhere, not just a reference. I find the rules described in that link kind of vague, and I also had never heard about the concept of library versions at all; if someone is in a similar situation, and just sees the link they may not realize it's actually explaining why it's different from the numbers above.\r\n\r\n> That's a good question. I'd like it answered in the release_process.md. How does Bitcoin Core do this? I would have thought everything is based off master except patches to earlier versions are done by branching off the earlier release branch. I think this would only have to be done for patches because it's unlikely we release a x.(y+1).z when (x+1).y.z is already released. Btw, \"revision\" isn't monotonically increasing, it's set to if there's any change to the interface (including additions).\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core's release process is roughly:\r\n* As a general rule, with very few exceptions, all PRs are made to the master branch.\r\n* Every so often the master branch is forked off to create a major release branch (e.g. the [`22.x`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/22.x) branch). After that point, future changes in master *may* be backported to the `22.x` branch if they're bugfixes or somehow specifically relevant for that release. At some point, release candidates `v22.0rc1`, `v22.0rc2`, ... are created from this branch, and finally the final `v22.0` tag is created.\r\n* Minor releases (e.g. `v22.1`) are created by continuing to backport changes (bugfixes, mostly) from the master branch into the `22.x` branch after `v22.0` is released, en then later in the same branch tagging `v22.1rc1`, `v22.1rc2`, ..., and `v22.1`. These can be made for multiple major release branches simultnaneously (e.g. a bugfix in master is sufficiently important that it deserves going into major releases 21 and 20 too, could be backported to all these branches, and then trigger release candidates/releases of new minor releases in all of them.\r\n\r\nSo the major difference with what you're proposing is that Bitcoin Core only has branches for major releases, not for very release, and that branch is then used for potentially multiple tags.\r\n\r\n> Btw, \"revision\" isn't monotonically increasing, it's set to if there's any change to the interface (including additions).\r\n\r\nIt's set to what if there is any change to the interface?",
