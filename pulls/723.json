      "description": "Motivation: libsecp is already widely used today, but often in a terribly outdated version. It's likely that a release process would help with that. Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",

      "body": "@real-or-random libtool --mode-execute is needed because when libtool is used to build a shared library the \"binary\" (e.g. the benches, or valgrind executable) you run isn't a binary. -- look at it, it's a shell script and the real binary is hidden in .libs.  The reason for this is so that it can run the real binary linked against your non-installed copy of the library rather than getting linked to the system library.\r\n\r\nIf you valgrind the wrapper script, that won't be terribly informative! :)\r\n\r\nThere is probably some official way to use libtool --mode=execute in a make check.  I hadn't even noticed that there was a local copy, that's probably part of it.",

      "body": "Unless the failure is extremely rare and specialized, documenting a failure thrown out by make check will just perpetually stop users from reporting other vaguely similar looking issues because they will find it and assume the authors already know or don't care.\r\n\r\nThere is also plenty of collateral damage possible.  A test failure here will cause some users to feel this library is unsafe and go pick some other code that not only doesn't have constant time testing but which doesn't make any effort to be constant time and isn't.  In the past we had issues where debian started refusing to upgrade their Bitcoin package after we added tests that failed on bigendian (at the time BE was totally unsupported by the software)-- debian had been shipping a completely non-functional BE package, once make check failed, the packaging process failed, and they refused to upgrade to a newer version that failed even though all the failure did was document the existing broken behaviour.\r\n\r\nAs far as users submitting fixes go-- If the worlds foremost experts in the software won't fix an issue, what chance does anyone else have?\r\n\r\nThese sorts of issues also are at high risk of being no one's bug:  The language makes no promises about constant time behaviour, so a compiler is not faulty just for making obviously constant time code variable time.  Simultaneously, if we can't get constant time behaviour from the compiler, there is sometimes little we can do (other than write more of the impacted routines in ASM).\r\n\r\nThe test serves a purpose because it helps find the introduction of behaviours that are grossly non-constant or subtle but easily avoided-- as a tool for reviewers.\r\n\r\nIf it were the case that that extensive effort had gone into making sure the tests passed on a huge variety of targets and all issues fixed such that the discovery was limiting additional improvements then there would be a case for using users to expand the search.  Without first having our own comprehensive-ish coverage we couldn't really tell that any proposed fix wasn't actually making the matter worse someplace else.   But that isn't where this test is right now.\r\n\r\nI'd much rather see this PR make it a separate check-like target-- but while there are known issues I think it would be counterproductive to have uninformed end users running it.  -- besides, valgrind isn't normally a dependency:  So if the test optionally runs when valgrind is present you'll have make check fail or pass randomly based on if valgrind is installed.",

If the Debian/Fedora/Arch Linux secp256k1 packaging process uses a compiler that produces variable-time code, then I'd really like to know about this. At the moment we're just blind. The fact that C does not guarantee constant-time compilation is exactly the reason why the user should run these tests.\r\n\r\n> If it were the case that that extensive effort had gone into making sure the tests passed on a huge variety of targets and all issues fixed such that the discovery was limiting additional improvements then there would be a case for using users to expand the search.\r\n\r\nYes, given unlimited resources, we should do this extensive effort, and then I see merit in your argument. But I don't believe that's realistic. Unless someone funds another three cryptographic people working full time on this library, this won't happen. With that said, I prefer to learn about issues now than never. \r\n\r\nFor users who switch to other libraries. Ok yes, there's a risk. But if we want to see adoption, there are other low-hanging fruits and we just need to get our hands dirty. There are so many open issues here that make people use other code: no example code, experimental ECDH, no public hash module (okay, debatable), no docs for manual building, and most importantly no release. And let's be honest, who's really working on this? A handful of people who have hundreds of other things that are more interesting than maintaining a library. We had better phases this year and last year but at the moment, we don't even have the resources to review incoming PRs.\r\n\r\nedit: If we want, we could still disable the test in Core, e.g., by setting `TESTS`.

      "body": "As it stands now the test fails on platforms these distributions targets!  So the result would be what I pointed out above w/ debian-- suddenly the distribution refuses to upgrade to new versions because the tests fail.\r\n\r\nHaving bitcoin core not running libsecp256k1 tests at all because a constant time test fails is not a good tradeoff:  To avoid a test that we *know* fails but only indicates behaviour that is usually inconsequential in most places bitcoin core is deployed, we'd disable detection of miscompilation that can cause a total consensus fault, direct leak of secret keys, etc. -- reports of issues that won't get ignored.\r\n\r\nAgain: We already know the test fails on some systems. You say \"If the Debian/Fedora/Arch Linux secp256k1 packaging process uses a compiler that produces variable-time code, then I'd really like to know about this\"-- but this isn't true:  We already know the fedora compiler on PPC64LE fails this test, and no one is interested in doing anything about it.\r\n\r\nSo what happens then when users show up reporting the same issue because make check fails? We already know it will fail in at least fedora's build process (and likely debian since it already supports PPC64LE).  Even if it weren't the case that it already failed, if no one maintaining this library can afford the time to spend a couple afternoons first getting this likely-to-fail test run one time on those distro targets (e.g. by finding people with relevant systems and begging them to run the tests, or asking a distro packager to do an experimental package build that runs the test)-- how can you expect that anyone is going to find the time to fix any additional reported issues?\r\n\r\nAt best all this does is teach them to not run make check because it reports issues that the developers don't care about and send off a signal that this library is unmaintained. Or it fixes distributors on old worse versions that don't fail, or worst it drives users to software which isn't even remotely constant time or doesn't even have tests (which would be pretty much every alternative to this library).\r\n",

I stopped testing more systems once I saw no interest in this known failure.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, why waste my time arguing me in a loop over this without pointing out that you didn't know that it already failed?  Your response is much less surprising to me now that I realize you didn't know that it was already known to fail.  If I thought that the test passed everywhere I would have been somewhat more supportive of running it by default. \r\n\r\n> Why is it set in stone that it's a couple of afternoons? The last one took me a few minutes\r\n\r\nIt usually doesn't take much effort to fix a constant time behaviour ... Except for complicated ones like \"oh gee, we can't use < in constant time code\"-- for that I think we're facing a big complicated rewrite, potential performance loss, and having to retest all over to make sure the fix doesn't move the non-constant time bug to another platform.\r\n\r\nBut whatever effort it takes to *fix* an issue it takes much less effort to get a single passing test result, which was really my point.  \r\n\r\nIf the project can't find the effort to get some tests run then it's not going to be able to muster the effort to fix issues that crop up.  Without the ability to retest fixes broadly you can't be confident that a \"fix\" isn't making the problem worse except on platforms you can test.  Having a year long iteration cycle where you try a fix for a users platform then 6 months later learn you broke a different user's platform (potentially an established one with many users) isn't a convergent process.\r\n\r\nThe best you can really do is have a set of platforms you're able to test (either directly or via community help) and be able to make some promises that the tests pass on those platforms.  Anything you can't test a proposed fix on is just a crapshoot because any change to the software, particularly any constant time fix for another uncommon platform, might break them.\r\n\r\n",
