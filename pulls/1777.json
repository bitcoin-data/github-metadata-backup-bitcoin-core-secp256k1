    "body": "Tackling the long-standing request #702.\r\n\r\nRight now we ship our own SHA256 implementation, a standard baseline version that does not take advantage of any hardware-optimized instruction, and it cannot be accessed by the embedding application - it is for internal usage only.\r\n\r\nThis means embedding applications often have to implement or include a different version for their use cases, wasting space on constrained environments, and in performance-sensitive setups it forces them to use a slower path than what the platform provides. Many projects already rely on tuned SHA-NI / ARMv8 / or other hardware-optimized code, so always using the baseline implementation we ship within the library is not ideal.\r\n\r\nThis PR gives our users a way to bring their own SHA256 compression, either at build time or at runtime, while keeping the default behavior untouched for everyone else.\r\n\r\n#### Compile-time: External SHA256 module\r\n\r\nThe built-in transform is moved out of `hash_impl.h`into a small sha module with its own public header (`secp256k1_sha.h`). The idea is to stop treating the compression step as a private, hidden detail, and instead make it part of a public interface that users can swap out if they want to.\r\nBoth build systems gain optional support for pointing libsecp to an external implementation:\r\n* Autotools: `--with-external-sha256=<path>`\r\n* CMake: `SECP256K1_EXTERNAL_SHA256_PATH`\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nDue to our current limitation of disabling C++ builds (see [this](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/b6c2a3cd7752085d46434921238401766c964c01/src/secp256k1.c#L15)), the provided external implementation must be written in C.\r\n\r\n#### Runtime: Context callback\r\n\r\nFor setups where we detect the available SHA256 compression function at runtime and cannot re-compile the sources, or when the function is not written in bare C89, there’s a new API:\r\n```C89\r\nsecp256k1_context_set_sha256_transform_callback(ctx, fn_transform)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis lets users plug-in their hardware-optimized implementation into the `secp256k1_context`, which is required in all functions that compute sha256 hashes.\r\nDuring the initial setting, as a sanity check, this mechanism verifies that the provided compression function is equivalent to the default one.\r\n\r\nAs a quick example, the changes required to implement this in Bitcoin-Core at runtime are very straightforward: https://github.com/furszy/bitcoin-core/commit/f68bef06d95a589859f98fc898dd80ab2e35eb39\r\n\r\nImplementing this at compile time in Bitcoin Core is possible, but it would require changing the C version we build against (which is not recommended). For example, we cannot link the SHA-NI implementation we have in Core (even if rewritten in C89) because it depends on the `arm_neon` library, which requires C99.",
