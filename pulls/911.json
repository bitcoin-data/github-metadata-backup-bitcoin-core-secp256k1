    "body": "This changeset introduces a level of indirection between the EC secret key compact representation (a big endian 32 byte value) and the secp256k1_seckey type.  This allows for the type to have an internal representation that differs in the future.  Because the types are compatible today, this breaks the API but not the ABI.  Callers should parse their compact keys with secp256k1_ec_seckey_parse_compact before using that value where a secret key is expected.",

Some possibilities for other representations include:\r\n* `secp256k1_scalar` (if that's 32 bytes), allowing saving the cost of byteswapping if you're going to do more than one operation with the same private key.

Goal again is source compatibility so 32 bytes today, but easily may become 96 if it becomes a private public pairing.  Really its expressing the type to prevent someone from doing something silly like taking an arbitrary byte stream (like a DER private key for example, or accidentally pointing to a public key byte array). I know this sounds a little silly, people using this library ought understand cyrpto enough to not do that 😆 ",
