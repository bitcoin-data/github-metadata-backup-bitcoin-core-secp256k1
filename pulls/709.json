            "title": "stable release (1.0.0-rc.1)",
            "description": "Motivation: libsecp is already widely used today, but often in a terribly outdated version. It's likely that a release process would help with that. Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",

      "body": "> this code gets faster on gcc and msvc if you make abs_n unsigned\r\n\r\nI don't especially like peppering code with unsigned values where it's not needed (e.g. for overflow or range purposes), as it risks creating bugs due to  promotion and it prevents some optimizations that depend on static analysis being able to assume overflow won't happen.  ... in this case the only justification for the performance difference is / behaviour using >> 1 instead of /2 should result in the same behaviour as changing things to unsigned.\r\n\r\nI also prefer the shift because on virtually every system an actual div instruction is extremely non-constant time. This means that the code is making a strong assumption that the compiler will perform strength reduction. I'm confident this isn't true and that sometimes they'll emit a div or a huge blob of division code on cpus without a divider arm (try -Os builds on older GCC).\r\n\r\nI think it would be best from a reviewability perspective if we just never use '/' or % on secret data.\r\n\r\nThanks for drawing my attention to this.",
