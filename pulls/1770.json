In practice, we call it only with `WINDOW_A == 5` and `WINDOW_G == ECMULT_WINDOW_SIZE` where the latter is configurable in the range `2..24`. \n> \n> A consequence of this \"bug\" is that the code fails on a 16-bit platform if you set `ECMULT_WINDOW_SIZE > 16`. I don't think we need to support this, but code without unchecked assumptions is bad. So I suggest that we rewrite the function to use `int32_t` instead of `int` even if we don't use my macro approach. (We can keep the \"bit position\" arguments and variables `int`.)\n> \n> Alternatively, we could add the assumption that `INT_MAX >= INT32_MAX` but this forbids 16-bit platforms, and the code seems to work on them in principle; see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/792#issuecomment-674488586.\n> \n> _Originally posted by @real-or-random in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1761#pullrequestreview-3432695127_\n>             </issue_description>\n> \n> <agent_instructions>Use the suggestion to use `int32_t` instead of `int`.
