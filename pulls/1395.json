    "body": "`random_fe_non_zero` contains a loop iteration limit that ensures that we abort if `random_fe` ever yielded zero more than ten times in a row. This construct was first introduced in PR #19 (commit 09ca4f32) for random non-square field elements and was later refactored into the non-zero helper in PR #25 (commit 6d6102fe). The copy-over to the exhaustive tests happened recently in PR #1118 (commit 0f864207).\r\n\r\nThis case seems to be practically irrelevant and I'd argue for keeping things simple and removing it (which was already suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1118#discussion_r1067259954); if there's really a worry that the test's random generator is heavily biased towards certain values or value ranges then there should consequently be checks at other places too (e.g. directly in `random_fe` for 256-bit values that repeatedly overflow, i.e. >= p).\r\n\r\nAlso, the _fe_normalize call is not needed and can be removed, as the result of `random_fe` is already normalized.",

      "message": "tests: simplify `random_fe_non_zero` (remove loop limit and unneeded normalize)\n\n`random_fe_non_zero` contains a loop iteration limit that ensures that\nwe abort if `random_fe` ever yielded zero more than ten times in a row.\nThis construct was first introduced in PR #19 (commit 09ca4f32) for\nrandom non-square field elements and was later refactored into the\nnon-zero helper in PR #25 (commit 6d6102fe). The copy-over to the\nexhaustive tests happened recently in PR #1118 (commit 0f864207).\n\nThis case seems to be practically irrelevant and I'd argue for keeping\nthings simple and removing it; if there's really a worry that the test's\nrandom generator is heavily biased towards certain values or value\nranges then there should consequently be checks at other places too\n(e.g. directly in `random_fe` for 256-bit values that repeatedly\noverflow, i.e. >= p).\n\nAlso, the _fe_normalize call is not needed and can be removed, as the\nresult of `random_fe` is already normalized.",
