    "body": "This add a simple static checker based on clang-query, which is a\r\ntool that could be described as a \"clever grep\" for abstract syntax\r\ntrees (ASTs).\r\n\r\nAs an initial proof of usefulness, this commit adds these checks:\r\n  - No uses of floating point types.\r\n  - No use of certain reserved identifiers (e.g., \"mem(...)\", #829).\r\n  - No use of memcmp (#823).\r\n\r\nThe checks are easily extensible.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose is to run the checker on CI, and this commit adds\r\nthe checker to the Travis CI script.\r\n\r\nThis currently requires clang-query version at least 10. (However,\r\nit's not required not compile with clang version 10, or with clang\r\nat all. Just the compiler flags must be compatible with clang.)\r\nClang-query simply uses the clang compiler as a backend for\r\ngenerating the AST.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the compile in which the code is supposed to be\r\ncompiled (e.g., compiler flags such as -D defines and include paths),\r\nit reads a compilation database in JSON format. There are multiple ways\r\nto generate this database. The easiest way to obtain such a database is\r\nto use a tool that intercepts the make process and build the database.\r\n\r\nOn Travis CI, we currently use \"bear\" for this purpose. It's a natural\r\nchoice because there is an Ubuntu package for it. If you want to run\r\nthis locally, bear is a good choice but other tools such as compiledb\r\n(Python) are available.",

This matches constant expression as seen from the point of view of the AST, i.e., this matches places where only constant expressions are allowed (such as after `case`). \r\n\r\nThis technique in general does not enable us to get insights on what the compiler will do with the code. It's really just pattern matching on the AST, so it's merely a clever grep. (One can do more advanced things with clang tooling but this requires more effort than writing matching expressions.)\r\n\r\nWhat we could do is to check if the divisor is an integer literal, but even this is not precise we have also a few `(x-1)` divisors for example.\r\n",

(However,\nit's not required not compile with clang version 10, or with clang\nat all. Just the compiler flags must be compatible with clang.)\nClang-query simply uses the clang compiler as a backend for\ngenerating the AST.\n\nIn order to determine the compile in which the code is supposed to be\ncompiled (e.g., compiler flags such as -D defines and include paths),\nit reads a compilation database in JSON format. There are multiple ways\nto generate this database. The easiest way to obtain such a database is\nto use a tool that intercepts the make process and build the database.\n\nOn Travis CI, we currently use \"bear\" for this purpose. It's a natural\nchoice because there is an Ubuntu package for it. If you want to run\nthis locally, bear is a good choice but other tools such as compiledb\n(Python) are available.",

It addresses the TODOs that didn't make it in the schnorrsig PR and changes the APIs of `schnorrsig_sign`, `schnorrsig_verify` and `hardened_nonce_function`.\r\n\r\n- Ideally, the new `aux_rand32` argument for `sign` would be const, but didn't find a solution I was happy with.\r\n- Support for variable length message signing and verification supports the [suggested BIP amendment](https://github.com/sipa/bips/issues/207#issuecomment-673681901) for such messages.\r\n- ~~`sign_custom` with its opaque config object allows adding more arguments later without having to change the API again. Perhaps there are other sensible customization options, but I'm thinking of [sign-to-contract/covert-channel](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/590) in particular. It would require adding the fields `unsigned char *s2c_data32` and `secp256k1_s2c_opening *s2c_opening` to the config struct. The former is the data to commit to and the latter is written to by `sign_custom`.~~ (EDIT: see below)\r\n",
