    "body": "This adds development snapshots of GCC and Clang to our Dockerfile, and -- as a prototype -- checks if CI likes this. I will later add a commit that actually defines some separate jobs.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear yet if it's a good idea to have these in a Dockerfile, or if this should be a separate Dockerfile, or no Docker CI environment at all. The advantage of the Docker CI environment is that the built Docker images are cached. But that's also the disadvantage. We probably want to rebuild the Docker image from time to time, and we can't do this automatically. The images are cached based [on the contents of the Dockerfile](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/docker-builder-vm/#dockerfile-as-a-ci-environment). I think it's possible to nuke the cache from the web interface, but we'd need to do this on a regular basis then.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it's not clear to me yet if these should be run as part of PRs and on master (as currently), or as cron/nightly builds or something else. I lean towards adding a few jobs to the current strategy (PRs+master) because I think moving some builds to nightly is an orthogonal question.\r\n",

This is not an issue in practice, as such failure can only occur with negligible probability, but the experimental compiler in that CI setting is technically correct in detecting this possibility.\r\n\r\nFix it by setting it to 1 based on a `secp256k1_fe_normalizes_to_zero` test rather than a `secp256k1_fe_is_zero` one (which does not require normalization).",

I lean towards adding a few jobs to the current strategy (PRs+master) because I think moving some builds to nightly is an orthogonal question.\r\n\r\nWhat I did now is something else:\r\n - Run *all* (14) Linux x86_64 jobs not only on gcc and clang, but additionally with gcc-snapshot and clang-snapshot (this gives us 28 additional jobs)\r\n - Instead of running the same 14 jobs on macOS jobs for both gcc and clang, reduce the macOS jobs to a more \"curated set\"  of 8 jobs (this removes 28-8 = 20 jobs) \r\n\r\nIn total, the number of jobs is increased only by 8, and it is 89 after this PR. My rationale here is that I think it makes sense to test many jobs on snapshots, and I didn't want to increase the number of jobs > 100.\r\n\r\nOpen to other suggestions and bikeshedding here. However, we should reconsider the macOS jobs anyway now that we can get Linux on native ARM64 too (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1163). The Linux tests are better (we get Dockerfile support, valgrind works, etc...) It still makes sense to test building on macOS, and it makes also sense to run a few tests there given that Apple's clang is a bit modified. But given that our actual code has almost zero interaction with the OS, I'd prefer to run just a handful jobs on macOS, and see if we can get more ARM64 testing on Linux instead. For example, we could move some of the x86_64 jobs to ARM64.",

As I said above, the image is cached based on a hash of the Dockerfile. So unless we change the Dockerfile, \r\n\r\nAs I wrote [here](https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-ci-docs/issues/544#issuecomment-1550303845), it's possible for a maintainer to trigger a manual rebuild by clicking \"re-run\" on a Docker task. My suggestion is simply to do this manually, say in every (or every second) IRC meeting. \r\n\r\nA similar alternative is that we have some kind of version number in the Dockerfile that we increment manually. We could again do this every two weeks or every four weeks. This is a bit inelegant because it needs a (trivial) PR every time we update. But the advantage of this is that we can postpone merging that PR if the update breaks...\r\n\r\nI'm open to suggestions to automate this, but I currently don't see a nice way to force this using Cirrus CI features.",

But I'm not sure and who knows if some of these will later be enabled in -O2. Is it difficult to build with ISL support?\r\n",

It will point to a different date, and so the name of the tarball will be different.\r\n\r\nOh sure...\r\n\r\n> You could replace the LATEST-14 directory with 14-20230702 which will not be invalidated every week, but then your CI will just be using the same snapshot forever.\r\n\r\nIndeed. Hm. The ability to pin a specific snapshot is probably useful. This means we'd need to update the dockerfile regularly (e.g., once per month) with a PR. I think that's okay. It's just a bit inconsistent if we don't do the same for the clang snapshots...\r\n\r\nFor now, I simply replaced this with a version that downloads the latest snapshot. (Using wget's recursion feature that recurses into downloading links.) I think any approach will be good enough as an initial attempt. We'll need to see how often we run into problems. \r\n\r\n\r\n> Or just use the ones built for this purpose smile\r\n\r\nYou mean those at https://jwakely.github.io/pkg-gcc-latest/ ?",
