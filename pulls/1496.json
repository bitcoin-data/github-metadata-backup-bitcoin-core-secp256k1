We now have the DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_SHA256 define which is what disable-asm actually did in practice.\r\n\r\nIf there is any desire, we can hook DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_SHA256 up to a new configure option that actually does what it says.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this is one of the last (THE last?) remaining uses of autoconf defines in our crypto code. As such it seems like low-hanging fruit.",

I'll try to rephrase:\r\n\r\nBecause notation is necessary for msan but not valgrind (I don't know if that's true, I'm assuming based on your question), there should be a macro that is used only to notate for msan without affecting valgrind's detection? If that's right, sure, I can hook up a `SECP256K1_CHECKMEM_MSAN`. I'm unsure if other parts of the code would also benefit from one but not the other, but presumably if so we'd want to switch them over too.\r\n\r\nedit: Like this, I think?

MSan's analysis needs instrumentation from the compiler, and it's not surprising that the compiler is not clever enough to understand our ASM and instrument the binary accordingly. Valgrind's analysis looks at the final (uninstrumented) binary only, and thus doesn't care at all if the code has been generated from C or asm or whatever.\r\n\r\n> there should be a macro that is used only to notate for msan without affecting valgrind's detection? If that's right, sure, I can hook up a `SECP256K1_CHECKMEM_MSAN`.\r\n\r\nThat's what I had in mind, yes.\r\n\r\n> I'm unsure if other parts of the code would also benefit from one but not the other, but presumably if so we'd want to switch them over too.\r\n\r\nI grepped for `SECP256K1_CHECKMEM_DEFINE`, and it turns out that all current uses of the macro are related to constant-time testing. In these cases, we'll actually need it for both MSan and Valgrind. So no, no need to change any existing uses.  \r\n\r\n> Nit: I think `SECP256K1_CHECKMEM_MSAN_DEFINE` would be a better name so the other macros could get the same treatment in the future if necessary.\r\n\r\nYeah, totally. Sorry, what I actually had in mind was that `SECP256K1_CHECKMEM_MSAN` (or perhaps better: ``SECP256K1_CHECKMEM_USES_MSAN`) is macro that indicates that we use MSan, and then we could do this after the asm code.  \r\n```\r\n#if SECP256K1_CHECKMEM_USES_MSAN\r\n    SECP256K1_CHECKMEM_DEFINE(...)\r\n    ...\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd there could also be a `SECP256K1_CHECKMEM_USES_VALGRIND` macro.\r\n\r\nI think that's a tiny tiny bit simpler in a possible future with more than two backends, but really, either approach is fine in the end. And I agree, if we follow your approach, then `SECP256K1_CHECKMEM_MSAN_DEFINE` is a better name for sure.",
