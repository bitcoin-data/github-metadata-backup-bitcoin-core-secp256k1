We now have the DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_SHA256 define which is what disable-asm actually did in practice.\r\n\r\nIf there is any desire, we can hook DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_SHA256 up to a new configure option that actually does what it says.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this is one of the last (THE last?) remaining uses of autoconf defines in our crypto code.
