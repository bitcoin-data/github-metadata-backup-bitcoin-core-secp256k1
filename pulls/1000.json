    "body": "Abstracts the int128 type and provides an native version, if available, or a implements it using a pair of int64_t's.\r\n\r\nThis is activated by setting the configuration flag `--with-test-override-wide-multiply=int128_struct`.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this PR is to take advantage of MSVC's [umulh](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/intrinsics/umulh?view=msvc-170) intrinsic that we can use to simulate an int128 type which MSVC does not have (AFAIU). This PR lays out the groundwork for this level of MSVC support, but doesn't include the configuration logic to enable it yet.\r\n\r\nFor completeness, and implementation of `umulh` and `mulh` are also provided for compilers that support neither the intrinsic nor the int128 type (such as CompCert?).  This also opens up the possibility of removing the 32-bit field and scalar implementations should that ever be desired.",

The only changes in association occur in the functions:\r\n\r\n* `secp256k1_modinv64_update_de_62`\r\n* `secp256k1_modinv64_update_fg_62`\r\n* `secp256k1_modinv64_update_fg_62_var`\r\n\r\nThe values being summed are all of the form `(int128_t)u * ??? + (int128_t)v * ???` (or similarly for `q` and `r`). The only way the new association could cause an overflow (or underflow) is if this previous calculation depended on some cancellation within the above addition term to prevent the final accumulation from itself overflowing.  However, the previous calculation does not depend on any cancellation.  The only assumed constraint on `u` and `v` (resp. `q` and `r`) is that `|u|+|v| <= 2^62`, which implies nothing about the values of `u` and `v` causing cancellation.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion, after the above and re-reviewing the above functions, is that neither the new (or old) order of addition risks overflow.\r\n\r\n",

(Maybe it's ok to just run them when we have a native type too and compare the result?). Most of these functions should be exercised by the current tests already but some may be not. For example, the `shift` functions are only called with specific shifts, so I think some branches will never be taken.  ",

Again, the `*_spec` definitions are probably the most important bits as they define the pre and post-conditions of the functions that form the statements of what I've proved.\r\n\r\nThe most notable change is that the specification for `secp256k1_i128_to_i64` was amended to remove the precondition that the input be a 64-bit signed integer value.  Apparently libsecp256k1 on occasion will cast signed int128 numbers to signed int64 numbers, expecting to truncate the bits.  That seems kinda dicey to me, but okay.",

We clearly can't promise testing on every possible hardware/OS/system/compiler combination, so we need to make some choices. Perhaps this is worth including once we have a release: a list of systems we're testing on, which is a subset of the systems we aim to work on (everything C89 + uint64_t, pretty much).\r\n\r\nIt's perhaps a bit strange to include code specifically to optimize performance on MSVC 64-bit ARM, without considering that platform tested. We could drop the optimization, but unless there is a concern that having code for optimization present would be misinterpreted as \"supported\", we could also just leave it for now.",

(The Internet says that mingw, which is basically \"gcc for windows\", will support the MSVC intrinsicts, but it will also have a native 128 bit, so we'll probably want to use the latter.)\r\n\r\nMSVC is what provides those intrinsics and `_MSC_VER` should really only be defined on MSVC. What about one of these two?\r\n\r\n```\r\n#if defined(_MSC_VER) && defined(_WIN64)\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\n#if defined(_MSC_VER) && (defined(_M_X64) || defined(_M_ARM64))\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, the two versions should be equivalent. This may change if MSVC starts to support another 64 bit target in the future, and then I believe it is likely that `__mulh` und `__umulh` will exist, so I lean for the first option. But anyway, when that change happens to MSVC, we can deal with it...\r\n\r\nParts of my comment are guesswork so far, I believe we'll need to test compilation.",

I think if you took care of this elsewhere in the entire file, it's meaningful to keep that \"protection\" (but I don't have a strong opinion).\r\n\r\nThough I think something like this is the idiomatic way of protecting against unsigned to signed promotion: \r\n\r\n```suggestion\r\n     r->lo = ((0U + r->hi) << (64-n)) | r->lo >> n;\r\n```",
