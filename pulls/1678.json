As an added benefit, that would avoid runtime path issues when building as a shared lib.",

      "body": "> Parent projects (Bitcoin Core in this case) may wish to include secp256k1 in another static library (libbitcoinkernel) so that users are not forced to bring their own static libsecp256k1.\r\n\r\nConcept ACK, this would be very helpful for py-bitcoinkernel. I'm in the process of porting the library to use the kernel C++ header, whereby I have to link against a static bitcoinkernel. Not having to also link to kernel's dependencies makes that process a lot more elegant, as tested with a patch very similar to https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/bc2aea3251602eb8f79356a63109573e5c37ea90.\r\n",

I also considered `secp256k1_objs_interface`, but that would lead one to believe that it has no sources/objects.\r\n\r\nThat's technically correct. The `SOURCE` property of the new target is empty.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, from a downstream project developer’s perspective, take Bitcoin Core as an example:\r\n```cmake\r\nadd_library(bitcoinkernel\r\n  bitcoinkernel.cpp\r\n  ...\r\n  $<TARGET_OBJECTS:bitcoin_clientversion>\r\n  $<TARGET_OBJECTS:bitcoin_crypto>\r\n  $<TARGET_OBJECTS:leveldb>\r\n  $<TARGET_OBJECTS:crc32c>\r\n)\r\ntarget_link_libraries(bitcoinkernel\r\n  PRIVATE\r\n    core_interface\r\n    secp256k1_objs\r\n    $<$<PLATFORM_ID:Windows>:bcrypt>\r\n    $<TARGET_NAME_IF_EXISTS:USDT::headers>\r\n  PUBLIC\r\n    Boost::headers\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can build all `bitcoinkernel` prerequisites except  `core_interface`:\r\n```\r\n$ cmake --build build -t bitcoin_clientversion bitcoin_crypto leveldb crc32c\r\n$ cmake --build build -t core_interface\r\nninja: error: unknown target 'core_interface'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new library clearly belongs to that latter group:\r\n```\r\n$ cmake --build build -t secp256k1_objs\r\nninja: error: unknown target 'secp256k1_objs'\r\n```\r\n\r\n> I think I'd prefer to leave it as-is unless you feel strongly.\r\n\r\nI don’t consider my comment to be a blocker.",
