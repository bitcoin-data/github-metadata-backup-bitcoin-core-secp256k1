    "body": "- Precomputed basepoint multiples are mapped to random iso\r\n- Per-scalar-mult extra cost of 1 field mult.\r\n- Per-blinding extra cost of 2000 field mults.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to choose a random non-zero field element 'iso' (u) and scale all the precomputed points so that (x, y) => (x.u^2, y.u^3). The (Jacobian) result point of each scalar multiplication is then mapped back via (x, y, z) => (x, y, z.u). Correctness depends on the group operations not involving the curve's 'B' parameter, which would have to be B.u^6 if it was being used.\r\n\r\nCurrently the static precomp. gets a randomised table but not the iso, so doesn't work.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR modifies _ecmult_gen_blind so that (repeated) calls with a NULL seed no longer reset the blinding each time. There was a test that exercised that reset, which I disabled, but it makes me wonder if there was some purpose to this.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Fixed mapping equation",

It's also the case that right now we don't have many (really any) vectors testing the whole system like that-- we should eventually but for now all the field and group corner case tests are low level and aren't interrupted by blinding.  (Part of the reason I haven't gone and built higher level corner case tests is because I thought it would be better to wait until after our blinding approaches were more settled.)\r\n\r\n[And why test field/group corner cases redundantly? sometimes interesting corner cases crop up in the whole system that a unit test misses-- e.g. zeros or infinities breaking algorithms.  Both high and low level testing are complementary and will catch different issues] ",
