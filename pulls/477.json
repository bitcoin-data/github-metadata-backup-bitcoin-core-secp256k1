Constant-time Shallue-Van de Woestijne here needs 1 inverse and 3 square roots. Even variable-time SVdW would need 1 inverse, 1.5 Jacobi symbols, and 1 square root.\r\n\r\nThe increment-and-test approach is indeed biased, and I'd prefer to avoid it, but using a hash operation rather than an increment would be fine (variable time doesn't matter here), and should be pretty fast when a fast Jacobi symbol is available (almost 2x the speed of the current PR, as it relies on using sqrt to test quadratic residues).",

      "body": "Thanks for the input! I've made some improvements.\r\n\r\n> In Bitcoin I am a little doubtful this approach is acceptable because it would add CPU hours to synchronization, multiplicative ( bitcoin/bitcoin#10434 ) has much better performance and a more robust security argument. But is less cachable so it has worse performance at the tip. It's a difficult trade-off.\r\n\r\nIt is currently running at ~14us/hash, which won't add CPU hours, but only a few minutes. Also, I am writing this as I am experimenting with hybrid prefix tree/rolling hash approaches for which 768 bytes/rolling hash isn't really an option.\r\n\r\n > This initialization is non-portable; data encoded in a ge_storage_t (or gej) is potentially platform and or compile option specific. What is that value in any case? Looks like a backdoor as is, Since if there is any possible collection of set inputs that sum to that value which can be computed, then the initial state is prefilled with that entry as a member; so the initial state should be a value which is unreachable by any known input. The norm in the codebase is to include sage code to generate and verify all non-trivial constants. Please explain precisely where this constant originates.\r\n\r\nGood point. Using ge_storage_t as multiset was a bit hacky.\r\n\r\nI was indeed using the constant to avoid infinite, but this was a rather silly idea. This breaks empty+empty=empty and more important derived properties. I now switched to a portable multiset type which handles infinity and properly using infinity as empty set.\r\n\r\n> Reprojecting to affine is devastating for performance and is entirely unneeded with the API setup here.\r\n\r\nGood point. My reasoning was, to use a 64-byte multiset, but the performance effect is indeed devastating (~25%). I now switched to a 96-byte (jacobian) multiset to avoid this. We could always add a 64 byte multiset_compact format if needed.\r\n\r\n> using a hash operation rather than an increment would be fine\r\n\r\nUsing a hash seems better indeed. I've switched to trial-and-hash instead of trial-and-increment.\r\n\r\n",
