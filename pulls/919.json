          "body": "#922 got me interested in mingw, so I started playing around and reading. Here are some notes that may save others time and should be converted into a PR at some point. I'd appreciate any comments from people more familiar with the topic (@gmaxwell, @theuni).\r\n\r\nsecp256k1 has been written to support mingw builds. As demonstrated in #922, these builds (still) work in general. But a few caveats apply.\r\n\r\nHere are some simple issues to start with:\r\n - [x] The Makefile is not written with Windows in mind. The most obvious issue is that they ignore the `.exe` extension, e.g., in `make clean` and for `gen_context`. [Automake has explicit support for this](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/EXEEXT.html), which we can rely easily rely on.\r\n - [x] When cross-compiling on Linux, it may happen that `configure` believes that we're not cross-compiling because it's possible to execute windows binaries with an installed Wine and `binfmt_misc` enables. (This happens on my system but not on CI). See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13150631/cross-compiling-why-checking-whether-we-are-cross-compiling-no#comment40154987_13150651. This by itself is not an issue: There's per se nothing wrong with configure building `gen_context.exe` and using wine to execute it. It's a little bit cumbersome though and together with the previous item that means that the `gen_context` invocation will fail. (#919 may improve this but could create other problems because invoking Python portably could be difficult.)  \r\n\r\nThe real fun starts with DLLs (shared libaries) which are a pain in the ass. When creating a DLL, one needs to declare exported symbols explictly using `__declspec (dllexport)`. We currently do this via in `secp256k1.h` via `SECP256K1_API` when `SECP256K1_BUILD` is defined.\r\n\r\nWhen using the library (i.e., `SECP256K1_BUILD` is not defined), one *can* declare the symbols explicitly using `__declspec (dllimport)`. We currently don't do this because the only problem is a [small overhead when calling a DLL function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-6.0/aa271769(v=vs.60)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) but the code still works. The reason to avoid `__declspec (dllimport)` is that *static* linking will fail. (I verified this by adding the declspec and configuring with `--disable-shared`.) [Unfortunately there's no way of telling whether we'll link statically or not, so the best possible thing is to have a macro that the user can set.](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/libtool.html#Windows-DLLs) (See also https://www.sourceware.org/autobook/autobook/autobook_137.html, https://autotools.io/libtool/windows.html, https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/314).\r\n\r\n - [ ] We currently don't have this macro. We could add it, maybe it's useful for someone and it won't create problems because it's not set by default.\r\n - [x] In order to be able to create DLLs at all, we need to add `-no-undefined` to the appropriate libtool LDFLAGS like `libsecp256k1_la_LDFLAGS = -no-undefined`. Otherwise libtool will tell us `libtool: warning: undefined symbols not allowed in x86_64-w64-mingw32 shared libraries; building static only` as seen on CI in #922. A workaround for now and for testing is to call make with `make LDFLAGS=-no-undefined`. Apparently this flag does not hurt on Linux, and none of the guides I found mentions that this should be only set on Windows, so we can just set this unconditionally.\r\n - [x] When building the benchmarks, we'll still get warnings like `./.libs/lt-bench_internal.c:41:5: warning: '_putenv' redeclared without dllimport attribute: previous dllimport ignored [-Wattributes]` but these are in the C code of the *libtool wrapper binary*, not in our code. (On Windows, this is an entire wrapper binary and not just a sh script as on Linux). I have no idea if this is a libtool bug or the issue is on our side but apparently the wrapper binary works, so we can simply ignore these for now. Having warnings is not elegant though, so it may still be interesting to ask on the libtool list to see what's going on.\r\n - [x] According to the [libtool](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/libtool.html#LT_005fINIT) and [gnulib](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/Libtool-and-Windows.html) docs, we should add `win32-dll` to `LT_INIT`. For me and CI, it seems to work without this, but I guess we should simply add it.  \r\n\r\n\r\nUff.",

          "body": " #1245 and its need for #1277 have shown that \"abusing\" autotools to generate prebuilt files is hard to understand, and remains hard to maintain. \r\n\r\n> With all this autotools mess, and since we don't even have these features in CMake, it would perhaps be cleaner to move (maintainer-)generation of the distributed files entirely out of the build system(s). This is currently hard since creating the files involves running a C program, which needs to be compiled, which needs some kind of build infrastructure. If we used Python to create the table files (see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/919), this would simplify some things. In particular because we have a \"maintainer dependency\" on Python anyway now with the test vector scripts.... On the other hand, all of this is work and I doubt it's worth spending our time on this right now.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @real-or-random in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1280#issuecomment-1514726159_\r\n",
