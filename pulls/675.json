      "body": "My long time experience is that optional caller-visible features in libraries on 'big systems' is pretty negative: All programs on the system share the same library so the system wide library needs to have all the optional parts turned on.  When parts get left off (e.g. when things get upgraded without package configs changing), you get mysterious failures.  Or you get stuff like applications where chunks of their functionality are silently omitted because some dependency three levels down had a build flag forgotten.\r\n\r\nHaving components which can be optionally disabled in specialized embedded cases is another matter-- I think that works out fine.  But those cases don't use pkg-config, so this wouldn't help them, nor do embedded-on-big-system cases like libsecp256k1 in bitcoin use pkg-config. AFAIK only the system-library sort of usage does, and that's precisely where optional library features mostly don't work.\r\n\r\nI don't think this change is harmful (except for the point about experimental features) but I think it's not a very good alternative to making all first class features (stuff that desktop applications could depend on being available) on by default unless specifically disabled.\r\n\r\n>  For those, something like this makes perfect sense.\r\n\r\nPkg-conf can detect the incompatibility but it doesn't do anything about it, you're still stuck with something that doesn't work, it can't tell you how to fix it.   A functionality test (e.g. trying to link the relevant functions) is an much stronger test for the functionality being available (which also does nothing about making it work).  \r\n\r\nHistorically the standard way of dealing with interface compatibility is via tests rather than sniffing for a variety of reasons, but mostly because a test is definitive. I would argue that it would be much better to just ship m4 tests for the modules that users could use, except not everything that uses pkg-config uses configure.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when something that used to be an optional module becomes a mandatory feature, e.g. because it matures or because some other component starts using it internally?  A test would pass (presuming the interface didn't also change at the same time), but checking for flags wouldn't unless a special effort was made to preserve all historical flags.",

In case the flag becomes a standard feature, the file can be installed always, the pkg-config files are tiny. And it is not likely to happen very often given that experimental features tend to go in the zkp library.\r\n\r\nThe reason I am requesting this, is because I'd like to probe for ECDH support [from Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html#pkg-field-pkgconfig-depends). Cabal supports pkg-config, but it doesn't use m4.\r\n\r\nCabal's solver can take your pkg-config list into consideration before choosing build flags for packages. It cannot probe for symbol existence.\r\n\r\nIf compilation were really the only proper way to probe, we wouldn't need packages or version numbers at all! But this is not the status quo.\r\n\r\nIf there is no easy way to probe for ECDH support, people are pushed towards just bundling libsecp256k1 builds everywhere. This remains an option either way, but I think it is too extreme if secp256k1 actively discourages OS packaging.",

      "body": "> It's much more common to use feature testing\r\n\r\nNormally, people use version numbers to solve this problem. For example, almost all Linux distributions have version numbers bounds on a package they depend on. Packages typically do not have optional features.\r\n\r\nThat's why you're not gonna find many packages providing more than one pkg-config module.\r\n\r\nThe version number approach translates well to binary packages since a package remains backwards compatible after adding symbols. Most people use binary package managers. Windows even had the practice of installing multiple versions of the C++ runtime library implementation, where you could consider the version number part of the package name.\r\n\r\nSince libsecp256k1 doesn't have releases or version numbers, that excludes this project from officially interacting with any binary package manager. This is what makes libsecp256k1 different.\r\n\r\nThe alternative of trying to use a symbol and then failing if it doesn't link, is AFAIK popularized by autotools, which predates pkg-config.\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, pkg-config is an addition that doesn't interfere with users who are not using pkg-config, so you are not forced to use it. Consumers can use `AC_CHECK_DECL` if they so desire. But since pkg-config is already used in this project, I don't see why you wouldn't use it properly.",
