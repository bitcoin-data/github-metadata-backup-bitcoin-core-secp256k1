    "body": "I'm not familiar enough with this asm syntax, there's probably a much simpler solution here, just switching to a test that doesn't need escaping.\n\nI Noticed this on OSX with clang, though it likely happens elsewhere as well.\nThe result is disabled x86_64 asm.\n\nDue to missing escaping, this $0 was interpreted as the function name\nSECP_64BIT_ASM_CHECK, causing the compile-check to be broken on some compilers.\n\nThe actual check looked like this:\n\n``` c\nint main()\n{\n  uint64_t a = 11, tmp;\n  __asm__ __volatile__(\"movq SECP_64BIT_ASM_CHECKx100000000,%1; mulq %%rsi\" : \"+a\"(a) : \"S\"(tmp) : \"cc\", \"%rdx\");\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIt seems even more odd that it compiled anywhere.\n",
