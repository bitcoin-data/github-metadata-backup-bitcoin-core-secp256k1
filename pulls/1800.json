    "body": "## Summary\n\nAdd assertions to `gen_split_lambda_constants.sage` to verify that the GLV decomposition constants arise from the Eisenstein integer factorization of the group order N.\n\nSpecifically:\n- `N = a^2 + a*b + b^2` (norm equation in Z[ω])\n- `λ = b/a mod N` (eigenvalue from Z[ω]/(π) ≅ Z/NZ isomorphism)\n\nThis addresses the suggestion in #1798 to document/verify the algebraic origin of these constants in the sage script rather than C comments.\n\n## Details\n\nThe group order N factors as N = π·π̄ in the Eisenstein integers Z[ω], where:\n- ω = (-1 + √-3)/2 is a primitive cube root of unity\n- π = a - b·ω is an Eisenstein prime with norm N(π) = a² + ab + b²\n\nThe GLV constants (A1, B1) correspond to the Eisenstein factors (b, -a), and the endomorphism eigenvalue λ arises naturally as the image of ω under the quotient map Z[ω] → Z[ω]/(π) ≅ Z/NZ.\n\nCloses #1798",

I've updated the code and the comment to address your suggestions.\n\nRegarding your question about the second assert:\n\nThe connection is:\n1. `pi = A - B*w` is an Eisenstein prime with `Norm(pi) = N`\n2. Under the isomorphism `Z[w]/(pi) -> Z/NZ`: `w -> A/B` (from `A - B*w = 0`)\n3. Since `(A/B)^3 = 1` in `Z/NZ`, we have `(A/B)^2 = (A/B)^{-1} = B/A`\n4. Therefore `LAMBDA = B/A` is the image of `w^2` under this isomorphism\n\nI've updated the comment to clarify this.",
