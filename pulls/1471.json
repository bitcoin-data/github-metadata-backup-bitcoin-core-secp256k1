    "body": "This PR adds a new Silent Payments ([BIP352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458)) module to secp256k1. At this early stage, this is meant primarily for demo purposes and to hopefully spark the scope/interface discussion started in #1427 with a more practical approach. The actual module is quite small with about ~600 LOC, a good part of it is API documentation.\r\n\r\nThe following routines are provided ($a_i$ are input private keys, $A_i$ are input public keys, $b$ and $B$ denote recipient privkeys/pubkeys that would be encoded in silent payment addresses, $d$ and $P$ the keypair for the actual transaction taproot x-only output):\r\n\r\n| Side     | Function                        | Inputs                           | Output                                                                    |\r\n|----------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|  Sender  | `_create_private_tweak_data`    | $a_1...a_n$, $outpoint_L$        | $a_{tweaked} = (a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n) * hash_I(outpoint_L \\|\\| A_{sum})$ |\r\n| Receiver | `_create_public_tweak_data`     | $A_1...A_n$, $outpoint_L$        | $A_{tweaked} = (A_1 + A_2 + ... + A_n) * hash_I(outpoint_L \\|\\| A_{sum})$ |\r\n|  Sender  | `_send_create_shared_secret`    | $a_{tweaked}$, $B_{scan}$        | $SS = a_{tweaked} * B_{scan}$ (ECDH)                                      |\r\n| Receiver | `_receive_create_shared_secret` | $A_{tweaked}$, $b_{scan}$        | $SS = A_{tweaked} * b_{scan}$ (ECDH)                                      |\r\n| Receiver | `_create_label_tweak`           | $b_{scan}, m$                    | $labeltweak = hash_L(b_{scan} \\|\\| m)$                                    |\r\n| Receiver | `_create_address_spend_pubkey`  | $B_{spend}, labeltweak$          | $B_m = B_{spend} + labeltweak * G$                                        |\r\n| Both     | `_create_output_pubkey`         | $B_{spend}, SS, k, (labeltweak)$ | $P_{xonly} = (B_{spend} + labeltweak * G) + hash_S(SS \\|\\| k) * G$        |\r\n| Receiver | `_create_output_seckey`         | $b_{spend}, SS, k, (labeltweak)$ | $d = (b_{spend} + labeltweak) + hash_S(SS \\|\\| k)$                        |\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n* $hash_I$ denotes a SHA256 tagged hash with tag \"BIP0352/Inputs\"\r\n* $hash_L$ denotes a SHA256 tagged hash with tag \"BIP0352/Label\"\r\n* $hash_S$ denotes a SHA256 tagged hash with tag \"BIP0352/SharedSecret\"\r\n\r\nFor ending up with output key material used for sending to / scanning for / spending from, both sides would follow the chain of `tweak_data -> shared_secret -> output key`. The public tweak data can be useful for faster scanning of output transactions by storing them in an index, see e.g. Bitcoin Core PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28241. Private tweak data is arguably less useful, so in theory one could collapse the tweak data and shared secret creation functions into a single one, but IMHO it's nicer if the API is symmetric.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1427#issuecomment-1757675172, the approach of passing in two separate key pairs for taproot and non-taproot inputs is followed here. This may seem a bit confusing at first, but has the advantage that the caller doesn't have to deal with enforcing even y-parity for key material manually (e.g. negating private keys of taproot outputs if they would end up in an odd point), which seems error-prone.\r\n\r\nThe last commit includes a small test suite written in Python that runs the BIP352 test vectors by calling into the secp256k1 shared library using [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html). All sending tests and the non-labels receiving tests currently pass.\r\n```\r\n$ ./configure --enable-module-silentpayments\r\n$ make\r\n$ cd bip352-testsuite\r\n$ ./run_bip352_tests.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis test suite is not meant to be actually included in the repo, but it hopefully shouldn't be too much effort to automatically generate the test code for `tests_impl.h`.\r\n\r\nHappy to receive comments, even if it's only bike-shedding ones (I'm fully aware that the current naming kind of sucks). Next step is to open a Bitcoin Core PR which uses this module in [#28122](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122), which should be ready within the next days.",

      "body": "Thanks for starting this! Will review. Just wanted to comment that I've made a round of edits to the BIP and it is now updated with the new hashing method (along with the tests).\r\n\r\n> The PR assumes that the outpoint hash is provided by the caller, but this could change in the future if its calculation involves elliptic-curve operations that would be a good fit for being done within the module as well.\r\n\r\nThe hash is calculated as *hash(outpoint<sub>L</sub> || A<sub>sum</sub>)*. Since it commits to the sum of input public keys used, seems like it might make sense to move it into the module? Otherwise, we'd have to do something like calculate the sum of the public keys, return that to the caller so that they can calculate an input hash and then send it back to us.",

Just wanted to comment that I've made a round of edits to the BIP and it is now updated with the new hashing method (along with the tests).\r\n\r\n👍 \r\n \r\n> > The PR assumes that the outpoint hash is provided by the caller, but this could change in the future if its calculation involves elliptic-curve operations that would be a good fit for being done within the module as well.\r\n> \r\n> The hash is calculated as _hash(outpointL || Asum)_. Since it commits to the sum of input public keys used, seems like it might make sense to move it into the module? \r\n\r\nYes, I agree. A naive solution based on the current PR state would be to provide another function for calculating the input hash and leave the others as they are, but then we would need to pass the input pubkeys and calculate the pubkey sum twice (once for the input hash, and once for the pubkey tweak data), which should be avoided. I guess we want to introduce a function for calculating $A_{sum}$ to reuse that result. Will try to figure out an interface. Suggestions would be greatly appreciated :)",

Labels support is also included, and all the test vectors from the BIP pass. The tests are still run from a Python script that directly interacts with the shared library via ctypes, I'll hopefully have something ready soon to create the actual tests in tests_impl.h from that automatically. The code was changed in many places to operate internal data types and functions in the routines (e.g. secp256k1_ge instead of secp256k1_pubkey, secp256k1_scalar instead of uchar-pointers to 32-byte chunks), which seems to make more sense and have less overhead.\r\n\r\n(The previous version of the PR is still available here: https://github.com/theStack/secp256k1/tree/silentpayments-module-demo_old)",

From my understanding, this is one of the \"expensive\" operations as it involves calculating the y value. This would mean either combining things into larger routines, or having the functions return points instead of serialized pubkeys. Curious what you think @theStack\r\n\r\nGood point, that's also something I've been asking myself. I think the expensive part of calculating the y-value only applies for loading `secp256k1_xonly_pubkey` objects though (not for regular `secp256k1_pubkey`s), and since those are not used for any intermediate results, it (hopefully) shouldn't be too bad. Directly using the group element type is not possible I think, as that datatype (`secp265k1_ge`) is internal and not exposed by the API. Would be great to get input from experienced long-term contributors in that subject.\r\n// EDIT: oh, you probably meant the raw 33-byte results of the ~~shared secret creation and~~ public tweak data. Maybe those should be changed to `secp256k1_pubkey` instead.",

IIUC, for the public keys sum case, this case could occur during scanning if someone crafted a transaction where the input pubkeys cancel each other out (trivially reachable with two pubkeys P and -P). It might make sense to have a return code signalling \"ignore this tx, it's not suitable for silent payments\" to differentiate it from an actual error that happened.",

      "body": "> EDIT: oh, you probably meant the raw 33-byte results of the shared secret creation and public tweak data. Maybe those should be changed to secp256k1_pubkey instead.\r\n\r\nYep! Sorry, my original comment wasn't very clear. But to be precise, what I'm referring to is anytime we have to de-serialize a public key encoding into a point (be it compressed or x-only), we need to calculate a `sqrt` to get the y-value, which is the \"expensive\" part. So if we only de-serialize once (taking the inputs from the user) and then for the rest of the process use points (i.e. (x, y) pairs) until the final step where we return the generated x-only pubkeys to the user, this should save us some work!\r\n\r\nAt a quick glance, it looks like you addressed this in your most recent push!

The rationale behind introducing those TODOs was to consider differentiating between the cases \"invalid input data is passed\", indicating that the user did something wrong (case 1 above) and \"the individual input data passed is fine, but we still can't continue\" (case 3 above). Since the transactions appearing in the mempool / block chain are not in the control of the user, such a \"point of infinity\" case could be triggered externally in the course of scanning for silent payments.\r\n\r\nIn Bitcoin Core, at some places we call secp256k1 functions with an additional `assert(ret)`, as we are confident that the input data passed is fine and the function always succeeds, e.g. several times in `CKey::SignCompact`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5fbcc8f0560cce36abafb8467339276b7c0d62b6/src/key.cpp#L255\r\n\r\nIn case of the pubkey tweak data creation routine, that would be a mistake as an external transaction could make a node crash in the course of e.g. the silent payment index creation. I guess we can avoid this though by just properly documenting in the API that the return code 0 also could mean \"tx is not eligible for silent payments\"? Maybe I'm overthinking here and users would hopefully always check for return values for more complex routines.",

      "body": "> \"invalid input data is passed\", indicating that the user did something wrong (case 1 above) and \"the individual input data passed is fine, but we still can't continue\" (case 3 above)\r\n\r\nThis is a good point. In theory, a user could recover from case 1, which at that point I'd agree we need two error codes: one to indicate that the user needs to do something different _with_ the current transaction in order to proceed, and another to indicated the can't do anything with the current transaction and it needs to be skipped.\r\n\r\nIn practice, I don't think case 1 is likely to happen often since the inputs already exist in validated transactions, it's just a matter of correctly extracting them. That being said, I am slightly leaning towards two error codes but I'd also prefer to be consistent with the other modules if we need a tie breaker. I'm curious if there is a general pattern in the library that we can take inspiration from.",

Not sure what I was thinking when writing this (\"Lord forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing\"...) 🙈 that's actually good news, as it results in less complex code.\r\n\r\n> We could just have the caller pass in one list of public keys (which means they would have already converted them to compressed keys by prefixing them with 0x02.\r\n\r\nNot sure about that part. For the module it would simplify the interface a lot, but do we want users needing to fiddle around manually with pubkey data (even if its only prepending a single byte)? See also the discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1427#issue-1920495384 \r\n\r\n> In contrast to private keys which are always just 32-bytes long for our purposes, public keys come in different sizes (33, 65 and 32 bytes) and formats (\"full\", x-only). The question arises how a user would pass in those different types in a single function call. Should we\r\n> \r\n> 1. Pass in two lists, one of the type secp256k1_pubkey, another one of the type secp256k1_xonly_pubkey? (The user would need to call the corresponding parse functions before, obviously)\r\n> 2. Provide a function that let's the user convert xonly-pubkeys to pubkeys first (in this context, this should be simple by just prepending a 0x02 byte, IIUC) and then only take a single list of secp256k1_pubkey elements?\r\n> 3. Something else?\r\n\r\nand @jonasnick's answer below:\r\n\r\n> Passing two lists seems like an okay approach. Conversion functions may just lead to additional confusion. Without them, we maintain this relatively straightforward model:\r\n> ```\r\n> xonly pubkey encoding -> use xonly_parse -> use in functions that accept xonly_pubkeys\r\n> compressed pubkey encoding -> use ec_pubkey_parse -> use in functions that accept ec_pubkeys\r\n> ```",

This function would multiply the private key and scalar and then do the ECDH step. We would then need *separate* function for the light client receiver only which takes `b_scan` and `A_tweaked` and does the ECDH step.\r\n\r\nJust brainstorming, open to other suggestions! Also might be prematurely optimizing but from what I understand ECC Multiplication is expensive, so keeping it to one for both sender and receiver seems worth it even at this stage.",

      "body": "Good point! I assumed that full node clients using silent payments would usually also be interested in the public tweak data to maintain a tweak index (like e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28241), both for the purpose of serving the data to light clients and for faster silent payment rescans, but didn't consider that this might not be the case for _all_ full nodes.\r\n\r\n> What if we had a single function that is used by both the sender and receiver, e.g.silentpayments_create_shared_secret, which takes the input_hash_scalar as an input and a private key (can be b_scan or a_sum) as inputs along with a public key (can be A_sum or B_scan). This function would multiply the private key and scalar and then do the ECDH step. We would then need separate function for the light client receiver only which takes b_scan and A_tweaked and does the ECDH step.\r\n\r\nSeems reasonable, though currently we don't expose `input_hash_scalar`, so we'd need extra routines to also calculate that. Have to think more about it, open for all suggestions. Glad that the interface discussion is unleashed!\r\n\r\n> Just brainstorming, open to other suggestions! Also might be prematurely optimizing but from what I understand ECC Multiplication is expensive, so keeping it to one for both sender and receiver seems worth it even at this stage.\r\n\r\nAgree that we should avoid these extra multiplications if possible.",

      "body": "That's actually also one of the interface questions where I'm not sure what's the right way to do it. As we don't have a fancy dynamic list type in C (like e.g. `std::vector` in C++), we will anyhow have to pass two arguments per list: one pointing to the data, the other one for the number of elements, but the question is how to structure the data. I chose flat-concatenated-bytes/pubkey-objects in a contiguous memory area, but on a second thought it's a pretty bad idea to demand from the user to concatenate all the keys before calling, involving a lot of copying. It seems a list of _pointers_ (ending up in a double-pointer) makes more sense?\r\n\r\nThat's also how other public secp256k1 routines do it, e.g. `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_combine`, where a list of pubkeys is passed in:\r\n```\r\n    const secp256k1_pubkey * const *ins,\r\n    size_t n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a list of private keys, I presume this would look like\r\n```\r\n    const unsigned char * const *ins,\r\n    size_t,\r\n```\r\n\r\n(note that there is no dedicated \"seckey\" data type in the secp256k1 API, it's just an `unsigned char` pointer to memory location where the 32 bytes key data is expected).\r\n\r\nI think the users would then use that somehow like this in C++ (untested):\r\n```\r\nvoid foobar(const std::vector<CKey>& keys)\r\n{    \r\n    std::vector<unsigned char*> privkey_pointers;\r\n    for (auto& key : keys) privkey_pointers.push_back(key.data());\r\n    secp256k1_create_private_tweak_data(..., ..., privkey_pointers.data(), privkey_pointers.size(), ...);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nShould I change the interface to list of pointers? That seems strictly better than the current interface. Or is there another method of passing in key lists that you could think of?",

      "body": "One easy possibility to avoid the extra point multiplication on the receiver side for full node clients:\r\n- change `_create_public_tweak_data` to only calculate and return a tuple (A_sum, input_hash), without doing the multiplication. E.g. with a new struct data type:\r\n```\r\ntypedef struct {\r\n    secp256k1_pubkey pubkey_sum;\r\n    unsigned char input_hash[32];\r\n} secp256k1_silentpayments_pubkey_tweak_data;\r\n```\r\n- change `_receive_create_shared_secret` to take an instance of this struct (instead of $A_{tweaked}$) accordingly, e.g.:\r\n```\r\nint secp256k1_silentpayments_receive_create_shared_secret(\r\n    const secp256k1_context *ctx,\r\n    unsigned char *shared_secret33,\r\n    const secp256k1_silentpayments_pubkey_tweak_data *public_tweak_data,\r\n    const unsigned char *receiver_scan_seckey\r\n)\r\n```\r\nIn that function, the shared secret would then be calculated via $SS = (b_{scan} * inputhash) * A_{sum}$\r\n\r\nThat would be a straightforward change. The only thing needed then for light clients (or nodes that want to create a silent payments tweak index) is an additional routine to calculate $A_{tweaked} = inputhash * A_{sum}$, given a `_pubkey_tweak_data` instance, and a possibility to calculate the shared secret from that $A_{tweaked}$. Should we have an extra shared secret creation routine for the receiver side that takes $A_{tweaked}$ (instead of the `pubkey_tweak_data` instance) and $b_{scan}$ (basically exactly what we have right now in the current PR state), or somehow abuse the `pubkey_tweak_data` structure to be also able to calculate and hold $A_{tweaked}$ already, e.g. with a flag (0=pubkey is sum, 1=pubkey is already tweaked with hash)?\r\n\r\nJust some ideas and mostly thinking out loud, happy to receive further input.",
