The public tweak data can be useful for faster scanning of output transactions by storing them in an index, see e.g. Bitcoin Core PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28241. Private tweak data is arguably less useful, so in theory one could collapse the tweak data and shared secret creation functions into a single one, but IMHO it's nicer if the API is symmetric.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1427#issuecomment-1757675172, the approach of passing in two separate key pairs for taproot and non-taproot inputs is followed here. This may seem a bit confusing at first, but has the advantage that the caller doesn't have to deal with enforcing even y-parity for key material manually (e.g. negating private keys of taproot outputs if they would end up in an odd point), which seems error-prone.\r\n\r\nThe last commit contains the BIP352 test vectors, converted to C code with a Python script. An earlier version of the tests, directly written in Python (by calling in to the secp256k1 shared library using ctypes) can still be found here: https://github.com/theStack/secp256k1/tree/silentpayments-module-demo_old5",

      "body": "Thanks for starting this! Will review. Just wanted to comment that I've made a round of edits to the BIP and it is now updated with the new hashing method (along with the tests).\r\n\r\n> The PR assumes that the outpoint hash is provided by the caller, but this could change in the future if its calculation involves elliptic-curve operations that would be a good fit for being done within the module as well.\r\n\r\nThe hash is calculated as *hash(outpoint<sub>L</sub> || A<sub>sum</sub>)*. Since it commits to the sum of input public keys used, seems like it might make sense to move it into the module? Otherwise, we'd have to do something like calculate the sum of the public keys, return that to the caller so that they can calculate an input hash and then send it back to us.",

      "body": "> Thanks for starting this! Will review. Just wanted to comment that I've made a round of edits to the BIP and it is now updated with the new hashing method (along with the tests).\r\n\r\n👍 \r\n \r\n> > The PR assumes that the outpoint hash is provided by the caller, but this could change in the future if its calculation involves elliptic-curve operations that would be a good fit for being done within the module as well.\r\n> \r\n> The hash is calculated as _hash(outpointL || Asum)_. Since it commits to the sum of input public keys used, seems like it might make sense to move it into the module? \r\n\r\nYes, I agree. A naive solution based on the current PR state would be to provide another function for calculating the input hash and leave the others as they are, but then we would need to pass the input pubkeys and calculate the pubkey sum twice (once for the input hash, and once for the pubkey tweak data), which should be avoided. I guess we want to introduce a function for calculating $A_{sum}$ to reuse that result. Will try to figure out an interface. Suggestions would be greatly appreciated :)",

Labels support is also included, and all the test vectors from the BIP pass. The tests are still run from a Python script that directly interacts with the shared library via ctypes, I'll hopefully have something ready soon to create the actual tests in tests_impl.h from that automatically. The code was changed in many places to operate internal data types and functions in the routines (e.g. secp256k1_ge instead of secp256k1_pubkey, secp256k1_scalar instead of uchar-pointers to 32-byte chunks), which seems to make more sense and have less overhead.\r\n\r\n(The previous version of the PR is still available here: https://github.com/theStack/secp256k1/tree/silentpayments-module-demo_old)",

From my understanding, this is one of the \"expensive\" operations as it involves calculating the y value. This would mean either combining things into larger routines, or having the functions return points instead of serialized pubkeys. Curious what you think @theStack\r\n\r\nGood point, that's also something I've been asking myself. I think the expensive part of calculating the y-value only applies for loading `secp256k1_xonly_pubkey` objects though (not for regular `secp256k1_pubkey`s), and since those are not used for any intermediate results, it (hopefully) shouldn't be too bad. Directly using the group element type is not possible I think, as that datatype (`secp265k1_ge`) is internal and not exposed by the API. Would be great to get input from experienced long-term contributors in that subject.\r\n// EDIT: oh, you probably meant the raw 33-byte results of the ~~shared secret creation and~~ public tweak data. Maybe those should be changed to `secp256k1_pubkey` instead.",

IIUC, for the public keys sum case, this case could occur during scanning if someone crafted a transaction where the input pubkeys cancel each other out (trivially reachable with two pubkeys P and -P). It might make sense to have a return code signalling \"ignore this tx, it's not suitable for silent payments\" to differentiate it from an actual error that happened.",

      "body": "> EDIT: oh, you probably meant the raw 33-byte results of the shared secret creation and public tweak data. Maybe those should be changed to secp256k1_pubkey instead.\r\n\r\nYep! Sorry, my original comment wasn't very clear. But to be precise, what I'm referring to is anytime we have to de-serialize a public key encoding into a point (be it compressed or x-only), we need to calculate a `sqrt` to get the y-value, which is the \"expensive\" part. So if we only de-serialize once (taking the inputs from the user) and then for the rest of the process use points (i.e. (x, y) pairs) until the final step where we return the generated x-only pubkeys to the user, this should save us some work!\r\n\r\nAt a quick glance, it looks like you addressed this in your most recent push!

The rationale behind introducing those TODOs was to consider differentiating between the cases \"invalid input data is passed\", indicating that the user did something wrong (case 1 above) and \"the individual input data passed is fine, but we still can't continue\" (case 3 above). Since the transactions appearing in the mempool / block chain are not in the control of the user, such a \"point of infinity\" case could be triggered externally in the course of scanning for silent payments.\r\n\r\nIn Bitcoin Core, at some places we call secp256k1 functions with an additional `assert(ret)`, as we are confident that the input data passed is fine and the function always succeeds, e.g. several times in `CKey::SignCompact`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5fbcc8f0560cce36abafb8467339276b7c0d62b6/src/key.cpp#L255\r\n\r\nIn case of the pubkey tweak data creation routine, that would be a mistake as an external transaction could make a node crash in the course of e.g. the silent payment index creation. I guess we can avoid this though by just properly documenting in the API that the return code 0 also could mean \"tx is not eligible for silent payments\"? Maybe I'm overthinking here and users would hopefully always check for return values for more complex routines.",

      "body": "> \"invalid input data is passed\", indicating that the user did something wrong (case 1 above) and \"the individual input data passed is fine, but we still can't continue\" (case 3 above)\r\n\r\nThis is a good point. In theory, a user could recover from case 1, which at that point I'd agree we need two error codes: one to indicate that the user needs to do something different _with_ the current transaction in order to proceed, and another to indicated the can't do anything with the current transaction and it needs to be skipped.\r\n\r\nIn practice, I don't think case 1 is likely to happen often since the inputs already exist in validated transactions, it's just a matter of correctly extracting them. That being said, I am slightly leaning towards two error codes but I'd also prefer to be consistent with the other modules if we need a tie breaker. I'm curious if there is a general pattern in the library that we can take inspiration from.",

      "body": "Force-pushed with interface changes in the tweak data and shared secret creation routines, following the latest suggestion in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1471#discussion_r1478572607 / https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1471#discussion_r1480186475. The tweak data creation routines now return both the key sums and input hash, without doing any tweaks yet, in order to avoid extra point multiplication for the full node receiver case (see discussion https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1471#discussion_r1468836824). Also, there is now only one shared secret creation routine left, with the parameters named `public_component`, `private_component` and `input_hash`. I tried documenting in the API description on what has to be passed depending on the scenario; unsure if this is sufficient yet, maybe there is a better, more clear way of presenting the expected parameters to the user (e.g. summarizing it in a table).\r\n\r\nOne open question is if we really need a dedicated routine to calculate `A_tweaked = input_hash * A_sum` (for light clients / silent payment indexes...). That routine would essentially be a copy of `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_tweak_mul`. Is it okay for the user to demand calling this routine, if it's properly documented, or do we still want do have a dedicated routine `secp256k1_silentpayments_create_tweaked_pubkey` that does the same, making it clear in the API what has to be passed?\r\n\r\nThanks for your review comments regarding labels and your POC branch @josibake, I will look at this closer in a bit.",

This way, you can do everything you need to do with just the silent payments module and don't really need to worry about the rest of `libsecp256k1`. In general, I think the goal for `libsecp256k1` is to further restrict the API and stop exposing routines for low level operations, so always wrapping in our own silent payments specific routines seems better.",

As for the out-of-draft criteria, I think we are pretty close, in my view the only two points missing are:\r\n- add another routine for creating $A_{tweaked}$, as needed for light clients / indexes (trivial, as it's basically a wrapper around `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_tweak_mul`), https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1471#issuecomment-1941333889\r\n- having more test coverage in plain C, I think every routine should at least be called once (ideally all test vectors are converted to C code by the Python script, like e.g. done for MuSig2: https://github.com/jonasnick/secp256k1/blob/musig2-module/tools/test_vectors_musig2_generate.py)",

      "body": "> @josibake: I've add the missing `_create_tweaked_pubkey` function to the API. As far as I'm aware, a user would have all the necessary routines now that are needed for a full silent payments implementation, without the need to do any manual ECC calculations (see also the summary table with formulas in the PR description). If there are no further objections, I'll move the PR out of draft within the next days, after increasing the test coverage a bit more.\r\n\r\nLooks great! I've updated [#28122](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122) to use this branch. I think we can take this out of draft whenever you're ready. While I'm sure the API will change with further review, this seems like a pretty solid starting point!",

This is accomplished by working directly with public and private keys, instead of needing a wallet backend and transactions for testing. Labels for the receiver are optional and thus deferred for a later PR.\r\n\r\nTest vectors from the BIP are included as unit tests.\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing, it is strongly recommended you read https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458 and take a look at the reference python implementation on the BIP.\r\n",

      "body": "Force-pushed with changes regarding tests and CI. The demo-only python test runner script has now been replaced by one that converts the [BIP352 test vector data in JSON format](https://github.com/josibake/bips/blob/silent-payments-bip/bip-0352/send_and_receive_test_vectors.json) to C code (`./src/modules/silentpayments/vectors.h`), that is in turn included and evaluated in the main test file (`./src/modules/silentpayments/tests_impl.h`). The last test vector is skipped in the generation script, as is it doesn't contain any silent payment eligible inputs; since the tweak data creation APIs require that at least one input is passed, a user would detect that and not call into secp256k1-silentpayments in such a case in the first place.\r\n \r\n> Looks great! I've updated [#28122](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122) to use this branch. I think we can take this out of draft whenever you're ready. While I'm sure the API will change with further review, this seems like a pretty solid starting point!\r\n\r\nAgree. I think there is still a long list of things that could/should be added (some manual tests e.g. for edge-cases, constant-time tests, benchmarks, examples, a proper `doc/silentpayments.md` document... anything else?), so the PR still feels early, but hopefully good enough as starting point. CI just showed green (enabled for silentpayments in the latest commit), so will move out of draft now.\r\n\r\nHappy to also take suggestions regarding ease-of-review. Should I squash the implementation commits? Personally I tend to prefer a higher number of small review chunks rather than the other way round, but I also understand that too many commits can trigger a \"the PR is too big to even look into\" sensation for potential reviewers.\r\n",

Not sure what I was thinking when writing this (\"Lord forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing\"...) 🙈 that's actually good news, as it results in less complex code.\r\n\r\n> We could just have the caller pass in one list of public keys (which means they would have already converted them to compressed keys by prefixing them with 0x02.\r\n\r\nNot sure about that part. For the module it would simplify the interface a lot, but do we want users needing to fiddle around manually with pubkey data (even if its only prepending a single byte)? See also the discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1427#issue-1920495384 \r\n\r\n> In contrast to private keys which are always just 32-bytes long for our purposes, public keys come in different sizes (33, 65 and 32 bytes) and formats (\"full\", x-only). The question arises how a user would pass in those different types in a single function call. Should we\r\n> \r\n> 1. Pass in two lists, one of the type secp256k1_pubkey, another one of the type secp256k1_xonly_pubkey? (The user would need to call the corresponding parse functions before, obviously)\r\n> 2. Provide a function that let's the user convert xonly-pubkeys to pubkeys first (in this context, this should be simple by just prepending a 0x02 byte, IIUC) and then only take a single list of secp256k1_pubkey elements?\r\n> 3. Something else?\r\n\r\nand @jonasnick's answer below:\r\n\r\n> Passing two lists seems like an okay approach. Conversion functions may just lead to additional confusion. Without them, we maintain this relatively straightforward model:\r\n> ```\r\n> xonly pubkey encoding -> use xonly_parse -> use in functions that accept xonly_pubkeys\r\n> compressed pubkey encoding -> use ec_pubkey_parse -> use in functions that accept ec_pubkeys\r\n> ```",

Haven't looked deeper, but I see that a dedicated caching data type is introduced there to avoid recomputations, maybe something like that could be useful for a BIP352 interface too.",

      "body": "That's actually also one of the interface questions where I'm not sure what's the right way to do it. As we don't have a fancy dynamic list type in C (like e.g. `std::vector` in C++), we will anyhow have to pass two arguments per list: one pointing to the data, the other one for the number of elements, but the question is how to structure the data. I chose flat-concatenated-bytes/pubkey-objects in a contiguous memory area, but on a second thought it's a pretty bad idea to demand from the user to concatenate all the keys before calling, involving a lot of copying. It seems a list of _pointers_ (ending up in a double-pointer) makes more sense?\r\n\r\nThat's also how other public secp256k1 routines do it, e.g. `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_combine`, where a list of pubkeys is passed in:\r\n```\r\n    const secp256k1_pubkey * const *ins,\r\n    size_t n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a list of private keys, I presume this would look like\r\n```\r\n    const unsigned char * const *ins,\r\n    size_t,\r\n```\r\n\r\n(note that there is no dedicated \"seckey\" data type in the secp256k1 API, it's just an `unsigned char` pointer to memory location where the 32 bytes key data is expected).\r\n\r\nI think the users would then use that somehow like this in C++ (untested):\r\n```\r\nvoid foobar(const std::vector<CKey>& keys)\r\n{    \r\n    std::vector<unsigned char*> privkey_pointers;\r\n    for (auto& key : keys) privkey_pointers.push_back(key.data());\r\n    secp256k1_create_private_tweak_data(..., ..., privkey_pointers.data(), privkey_pointers.size(), ...);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nShould I change the interface to list of pointers? That seems strictly better than the current interface. Or is there another method of passing in key lists that you could think of?",

E.g. with a new struct data type:\r\n```\r\ntypedef struct {\r\n    secp256k1_pubkey pubkey_sum;\r\n    unsigned char input_hash[32];\r\n} secp256k1_silentpayments_pubkey_tweak_data;\r\n```\r\n- change `_receive_create_shared_secret` to take an instance of this struct (instead of $A_{tweaked}$) accordingly, e.g.:\r\n```\r\nint secp256k1_silentpayments_receive_create_shared_secret(\r\n    const secp256k1_context *ctx,\r\n    unsigned char *shared_secret33,\r\n    const secp256k1_silentpayments_pubkey_tweak_data *public_tweak_data,\r\n    const unsigned char *receiver_scan_seckey\r\n)\r\n```\r\nIn that function, the shared secret would then be calculated via $SS = (b_{scan} * inputhash) * A_{sum}$\r\n\r\nThat would be a straightforward change. The only thing needed then for light clients (or nodes that want to create a silent payments tweak index) is an additional routine to calculate $A_{tweaked} = inputhash * A_{sum}$, given a `_pubkey_tweak_data` instance, and a possibility to calculate the shared secret from that $A_{tweaked}$. Should we have an extra shared secret creation routine for the receiver side that takes $A_{tweaked}$ (instead of the `pubkey_tweak_data` instance) and $b_{scan}$ (basically exactly what we have right now in the current PR state), or somehow abuse the `pubkey_tweak_data` structure to be also able to calculate and hold $A_{tweaked}$ already, e.g. with a flag (0=pubkey is sum, 1=pubkey is already tweaked with hash)?\r\n\r\nJust some ideas and mostly thinking out loud, happy to receive further input.",

This would also allow us to simplify things a bit and use a single routine for shared secret creation for both sender and receiver:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntypedef struct {\r\n    secp256k1_pubkey pubkey;\r\n    unsigned char input_hash[32];\r\n} secp256k1_silentpayments_pubkey_tweak_data;\r\n\r\nint secp256k1_silentpayments_create_shared_secret(\r\n    const secp256k1_context *ctx,\r\n    unsigned char *shared_secret33,\r\n    const secp256k1_silentpayments_pubkey_tweak_data *public_tweak_data,\r\n    const unsigned char *seckey\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `pubkey` represents either the pubkey sum or the receivers scan public key and `seckey` represents either the senders secret key sum or the receivers scan private key. I think this would require modifying your `_sender` routines a bit, e.g. have the sender routine first sum the secret keys and then call the shared routine `_silentpayments_create_shared_secret`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor the receiver, yes, I think we would need the two routines you mentioned:\r\n\r\n* one for creating $A_{tweaked}$ (i.e. $A_{tweaked} = inputhash * A_{sum}$)\r\n* one for creating a shared secret from $A_{tweaked}$ (i.e. $SS = b_{scan} * A_{tweaked}$)\r\n\r\nThese could also be the same routine since they are essentially doing the same thing ($d * P$) and both return `unsigned char data[33]`, either to be written to an index/sent to light clients or hashed with $k$ to create an output.

This would also allow us to simplify things a bit and use a single routine for shared secret creation for both sender and receiver:\r\n> ...\r\n\r\nConsolidating the API to a single shared secret creation function for both directions would be nice indeed. One drawback could be though that it is likely more confusing for the user and it's a bit easier to use it wrong; since the paramters can't be named exactly after what is expected anymore (e.g. `receiver_scan_pubkey`), they have to have more generic names (e.g. `pubkey_part`, `privkey_part` or sth alike), as it now depends on the direction. But that can (hopefully) be compensated by good API documentation? Not sure yet, but I think we should give it a try.\r\n\r\nEven the shared secret creation for light clients (passing $A_{tweaked}$) case could be done by that same routine, by making one parameter optional (i.e. if `input_hash` is NULL, that signals that the tweak is already included in the passed pubkey). Another suggestions based on that, where the newly introduced `struct` from the previous comment doesn't exist anymore:\r\n```\r\nTweak data creation:\r\n  _create_private_tweak_data -> returns (a_sum, input_hash)\r\n  _create_public_tweak_data  -> returns (A_sum, input_hash)\r\n\r\nShared secret creation:\r\n  Sender:                  _create_shared_secret(..., ..., B_scan, a_sum, input_hash)\r\n  Receiver (Full node):    _create_shared_secret(..., ..., A_sum, b_scan, input_hash)\r\n  Receiver (Light client): _create_shared_secret(..., ..., A_tweaked, b_scan, NULL)\r\n```\r\n\r\n> For the receiver, yes, I think we would need the two routines you mentioned:\r\n> \r\n> * one for creating Atweaked (i.e. Atweaked=inputhash∗Asum)\r\n> * one for creating a shared secret from Atweaked (i.e. SS=bscan∗Atweaked)\r\n> \r\n> These could also be the same routine since they are essentially doing the same thing (d∗P) and both return `unsigned char data[33]`, either to be written to an index/sent to light clients or hashed with k to create an output. What do you think?\r\n\r\nThose two calculations are different in the sense that the shared secret creation one does a full ECDH including the call of the ECDH hash function, while the other one is just a normal point multiplication (less critical, as there is no secret key material involved, IIUC). So I think a dedicated routine for creating `A_tweaked` from `(input_hash, A_sum)` is still needed. For that one, it probably makes sense to include the serialization to the 33-bytes already, as the user would need to do that for storing it in an index or sending it to the light client anyway.",

Another for using the same routine for both sender and receiver is we ensure that sender and receiver will arrive at the same shared secret (provided they give correct inputs), since they are using the same routine. If we use separate routines, there is a small chance of introducing a bug in one of the routines that would cause the sender and receiver to arrive at different shared secrets despite giving the correct inputs.\r\n\r\n> Even the shared secret creation for light clients (passing ) case could be done by that same routine, by making one parameter optional (i.e. if input_hash is NULL, that signals that the tweak is already included in the passed pubkey)\r\n\r\nAlso not a bad idea! I'd say we can go with this for now and always revert to multiple routines if there are objections.\r\n\r\n> Those two calculations are different in the sense that the shared secret creation one does a full ECDH including the call of the ECDH hash function, while the other one is just a normal point multiplication\r\n\r\nGood point, I forgot about that. I think the main difference here is that ECDH is done in constant time whereas point multiplication is not. Regardless, you're correct that these should remain separate routines and I agree we should just return the 33 byte serialized pubkey for the routine creating the light client/index data.",

For the sender, what you have here is perfect. For the receiver, [GetTxOutputTweaks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/de7dd3aaf64bc9812ac4c30994ee6fbb5695e953/src/wallet/silentpayments.cpp#L162) (from #28122) returns `t_k` instead of the full output, which allows the wallet to scan without ever needing the private key `b_spend`. The idea here is `t_k` can be stored in the wallet and then added to `b_spend` at signing time. Additionally, the receiver needs to perform the following steps when scanning for labels:\r\n\r\n* calculate `tx_output - P_k`\r\n* calculate `- tx_output - P_k`\r\n\r\nWhat if we renamed `_create_output_pubkey` to `_sender_create_output_pubkey` and added a new function for the receiver, something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntypedef struct {\r\n    unsigned char t_k[32];\r\n    secp256k1_xonly_pubkey xonly_output;\r\n    secp256k1_pubkey label;\r\n    secp256k1_pubkey label_negated;\r\n} secp256k1_silentpayments_scanning_data;\r\n\r\nint secp256k1_silentpayments_receiver_create_scanning_data(\r\n    const secp256k1_context *ctx,\r\n    secp256k1_silentpayments_scanning_data *scanning_data,\r\n    const unsigned char *shared_secret33,\r\n    const secp256k1_pubkey *receiver_spend_pubkey,\r\n    unsigned int k\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `_receiver_create_scanning_data` creates the output same as before and also calculates `label_pubkey = tx_output + P_k_negated` and `label_pubkey_negated = tx_output_negated + P_k_negated`.\r\n\r\nThis way, if `xonly_output` matches one of the transaction outputs, we add `t_k` to the wallet. If `xonly_output` doesn't match, we check if `label_pubkey` or `label_pubkey_negated` is in our labels cache and if there is a match we add `t_k + label_tweak` to the wallet.\r\n\r\nIf the scanning client is not using labels, they can just ignore the label data and move on if they don't find a match for `xonly_pubkey`. Creating the label data only involves a few negations and EC additions so I don't think it hurts to always calculate it. The alternative would be *even moar routines:* one for receiving clients that use labels and one for receiving clients that don't.\r\n\r\nWDYT?",

So lets say I have 100k labels and I'm checking a tx with 100 outputs.. I'd doing `2 * 100k * 100` hashes, along with `100k * 100` EC additions, etc.\r\n\r\nSince the receiver already has to generate the label to use it, the idea is they would store the label (something like `{(B_spend + label_tweak * G) : label_tweak}` so that when scanning they can calculate `label = tx_output - P_k` and `label = tx_output_negated - P_k`. This means that regardless of the number of labels used, they only have to do at most two look ups in their label cache when scanning.",

IIUC, trying to summarize:\r\n1. calculating $P_k$ (from $SS$, $B_{spend}$ and $k$) is always needed as bare minimum for both sides, i.e. either for output creation (sender) or as first step for scanning (receiver)\r\n2. for the receiver, the tweak $t_k$ is also relevant (to be stored in the wallet for spending later, without the need to involve $b_{spend}$ yet)\r\n3. only receivers with labels support have to process $P_k$ further (together with the actual output of the scanned tx) and calculate `label` and `label_negated`\r\n\r\nTo add another interface possibility, would it work to have steps 1. and 2. done in one routine (basically the one we have already now, with the only change that it also optionally returns $t_k$), and step 3. in a separate one?\r\n\r\nThe interface would look like\r\n```\r\nint secp256k1_silentpayments_create_output_pubkey(\r\n    const secp256k1_context *ctx,\r\n    secp256k1_xonly_pubkey *output_xonly_pubkey,\r\n    unsigned char *t_k,\r\n    const unsigned char *shared_secret33,\r\n    const secp256k1_pubkey *receiver_spend_pubkey,\r\n    unsigned int k\r\n);\r\n```\r\n(senders can pass in NULL for `t_k` as they don't have any use for it), and\r\n```\r\nint secp256k1_silentpayments_create_scan_labels(\r\n    const secp256k1_context *ctx,\r\n    secp256k1_pubkey *label,\r\n    secp256k1_pubkey *label_negated,\r\n    const secp256k1_xonly_pubkey *P_output,\r\n    const secp256k1_xonly_pubkey *tx_output\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nDepending on the role and labels support, the following needs to be done:\r\n* Sender: call `secp256k1_silentpayments_create_output_pubkey` (with `t_k` set to NULL to avoid having to store dummy data), create tx with output $P_{output}$\r\n* Receiver:\r\n    * call `secp256k1_silentpayments_create_output_pubkey` (with `t_k` set to non-NULL)\r\n    * if $P_{output}$ equals $tx_{output}$, add $t_k$ to wallet and proceed with next `k` value\r\n    * if labels are supported\r\n        * call `secp256k1_silentpayments_create_scan_labels` with $P_{output}$ and $tx_{output}$\r\n        * if any of the results match the labels cache, add $t_k + labeltweak$ to the wallet\r\n     * proceed with next `k` value\r\n\r\nThat way we would only have to calculate the scan label data if it's needed / supported. What do you prefer, especially w.r.t. using it in #28122? Grouping by dedicated `sender_` and `receiver_` routines also has its advantages though in terms of readability for the user. I'm fine with either approach.",

Initially, my thinking was its better to keep it all in one routine because we avoid needing to save `P_output` as a `secp256k1_pubkey` only to load it back into a `secp256k1_ge/gej` group element for label processing, but I suspect this conversion is trivial enough.\r\n\r\nLet's go with the interface you proposed and keep the functions separate for now.",

      "body": "> Small correction: per the BIP, it is recommended the receiver always check for the change label. That being said, I somewhat prefer what you're proposing here with a separate routine for generating the label data. Initially, my thinking was its better to keep it all in one routine because we avoid needing to save P_output as a secp256k1_pubkey only to load it back into a secp256k1_ge/gej group element for label processing, but I suspect this conversion is trivial enough.\r\n\r\nFair point with the pubkey <-> ge/gej conversions, didn't think about that. I also presume that these are not hurting the performance in a significant way though.\r\n\r\n> Let's go with the interface you proposed and keep the functions separate for now.\r\n\r\nUpdated the PR with the proposed interface changes, with one caveat: my suggestion of returning `P_output` only as x-only pubkey in `_create_output_pubkey` doesn't work, as the parity is needed for the scan label calculation for the receiver. The x-only format OTOH is handy both for the sender (for creating the taproot output) and the receiver (for the first scanning step, where the tx's taproot output is directly compared to the calculated pubkey). So I've went now with returning P both in x-only and plain pubkey format, where the second is optional.\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to only return the plain pubkey and document properly that users have to convert that to an x-only-pubkey via `secp256k1_xonly_pubkey_from_pubkey` after, for the purpose of output creation / the first scanning step. I feel that it's better if the users don't have to do any manual plain -> xonly pubkey conversions and having an interface with one parameter more is the lesser evil here, if the API documentation is clear enough. Thoughts?",

One small annoyance of the current interface is that one of the calculated labels is invalid if the calculated and scanned output match (i.e. $P_{output} == tx_{output}$), as this results in the point of infinity. If the users behave correctly, they should only ever look at the labels if there's a mismatch between scanned and calculated outputs, so this is probably not a problem.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Hah, I don't know if there is a good answer here. Our options are:\r\n\r\n* Don't do the check and always compute the label data - this means in the event of finding an output, we are doing a few unnecessary EC negations / additions and one of the labels we return is the point at infinity. Not too big a deal, since this would be unusable by the caller anyways\r\n* Do the check to avoid computing label data when we don't need it - this means the caller will end up doing the check again\r\n* Return a boolean (which is a separate in param, instead of the functions normal `int` return) which is checked by the caller. If false, look at the label data (if using)\r\n\r\nUsing the boolean approach seems like the most efficient of the options and avoids calculating / returning unnecessary data, at the expense of a slightly awkward API. Personally, I'm leaning toward performance given that scanning is a resource intensive operation.",

      "body": "Had very similar thoughts today with the same conclusion. What is indeed a bit unclean about the return-a-boolean API is the fact that the responsibilities of \"creating scan data\" and \"scanning\" are not strictly separated anymore, as the latter would now be done also partly by the secp module (for the direct match), and partly by the caller (for the labels). As an upside though, it's more efficient and also leads to less code for the caller, so I'd think it's maybe not a conceptually perfect, but practically still the most reasonable choice from the variants we considered so far. \r\n\r\nWill update that tomorrow, shouldn't take too long. Do you think we should rename the function, now that it's not only creating scan data, but doing also the first part of the scan? (e.g. simply `_receiver_scan_output`?)",

If not, seems like it would be better to have the API accept private keys as an input and return the final shared secret. Otherwise, callers need to be really careful with `a_sum` as it could be a single private key.\r\n\r\nWhat about renaming this function to something like `secp256k1_silentpayments_create_shared_secret_from_private_data` and it returns `unsigned char shared_secret33`. This way, we can pass pointers to the privkey data and get back the shared secret without needing to worry about handling a potentially dangerous `a_sum` in between.",

The other option would be to add another routine for combining the tweaks. The only advantage I can think of here is for HWW, where it might be more convenient to pass the combined tweak (32 bytes) instead of `t_k` and `label` (64 bytes) when signing. In all other cases, the receiver would have already calculated `label` or can cheaply recalculate it with `scan_seckey` and `m`, so leaning toward keeping this as is.",

If not, seems like it would be better to have the API accept private keys as an input and return the final shared secret. Otherwise, callers need to be really careful with `a_sum` as it could be a single private key.\r\n\r\nThe only `a_sum`/`input_hash` reuse scenario I could think of is one where the sender wants to create a transaction with more than one silent payments recipient (and with that, different scan pubkeys, i.e. the same recipient with different labels but same scan pubkey wouldn't count as \"different\" in that sense). Given that sending is an infrequent scenario and calculating a_sum and input_hash are comparably cheap operations, that's probably not a big deal though. The receiving/scanning part is potentially more of a problem, see comment below.\r\n",

      "body": "> in \"silentpayments: add public tweak data creation routine\" ([98f5ba4](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/commit/98f5ba4aa69e2b86d32fab649e65730a0a998a12)):\r\n> \r\n> Similarly (see previous comment), we could rename this function to something like `_create_shared_secret_from_public_data` where it takes all the arguments and returns `unsigned char *shared_secret33`. The advantages here are:\r\n> \r\n> 1. We can avoid returning needing to convert `ge -> secp256k1_pubkey -> ge` (the caller also doesn't need to know anything about `secp256k1_pubkey`)\r\n> 2. Less confusing for full node sender and receiver since they now only need one function call each and don't need to worry about the ambiguity with `_create_shared_secret`'s arguments\r\n\r\nNice idea, I think that interface would indeed be easier for users. The drawback I see here is that if a wallet scans for multiple silent payments addresses (ones that differ in the scan pubkey part), it is more costly, as the intermediate results of `A_sum`/`input_hash` can't be reused. E.g. deriving the shared secrets when scanning for both `B1_scan`/`B1_spend` and `B2_scan`/`B2_spend`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCurrent interface:\r\n    A_sum, input_hash = _create_public_tweak_data(input_pubkeys, input_xonly_pubkeys, outpoint_smallest)\r\n    SS1 = _create_shared_secret(A_sum, b1_scan, input_hash)\r\n    SS2 = _create_shared_secret(A_sum, b2_scan, input_hash)\r\n    -> A_sum and input_hash only calculated once\r\n\r\nProposed interface:\r\n    SS1 = _create_shared_secret_from_public_data(inputs_plain, inputs_taproot, outpoint_smallest, b1_scan)\r\n    SS2 = _create_shared_secret_from_public_data(inputs_plain, inputs_taproot, outpoint_smallest, b2_scan)\r\n    -> A_sum and input_hash need to be calculated twice\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan we live with that? Would that be common or is it much more likely that the scan keypair is constant and a user would only work with labels on the same scan pubkey anyway? Not sure what the typical usecase would be here in the future, interested about your thoughts about that. Without having numbers, I could imagine that summing up pubkeys is insignifcant compared to the point multiplication in the ECDH step, but it's still a bit ugly that for scanning $n$ different addresses, the pubkey summing and input hashing has to be repeated $n$ times.\r\n\r\n",

This could be a fairly common usecase (e.g. an exchange processing withdrawals to $n$ silent payment addresses), but it is still a bounded problem in that you can't send to more than $N$ silent payment addresses in a single transaction, where $N$ is the number of outputs you can fit in a single block.\r\n\r\nI'm leaning toward making this so the caller doesn't need to handle intermediary secret data.

Not convinced this is strictly better, but curious to hear your thoughts.\r\n\r\nSeems to be a good idea to create all the label-related data directly in one shot. I imagine that a wallet would typically also want to create the labelled address and put its corresponding data into the labels cache at the same instant. Are there use-cases for creating labelled addresses given a labelled pubkey without having access to private key data? If yes, then the current interface is probably better though. If not, I'd prefer your suggested interface (one routine less, yay!).",

This could be a fairly common usecase (e.g. an exchange processing withdrawals to n silent payment addresses), but it is still a bounded problem in that you can't send to more than N silent payment addresses in a single transaction, where N is the number of outputs you can fit in a single block.\r\n> \r\n> I'm leaning toward making this so the caller doesn't need to handle intermediary secret data. The other option is we expose both routines in the API?\r\n\r\nOops, I missed this comment last week. I agree that a `secp256k1_silentpayments_create_shared_secret_from_private_data` routine would be useful for the reasons you mentioned (i.e. avoid having to handle intermediate secret key data), will add one in a bit. I tend to think that exposing both routines still makes sense, in cases where performance for sending to multiple receivers is really a concern? Will keep the current one around for discussion, if it's not considered useful it can still be removed later.",
