    "body": "This PR splits up the pubkey serialization function `secp256k1_eckey_pubkey_serialize` into two variants for the compressed (33 bytes) and uncompressed (65 bytes) public key output format each, where only non-infinity group elements as input are allowed. The motivation is to simplify call-sites significantly, as they currently need to introduce two variables and a VERIFY_CHECKs on the return value and the in/out size parameter within a pre-processor block, typically leading to 8 lines of code. By using the new functions, the code is reduced to a single line of code that just calls the function (see #1773). This is helpful for already existing modules on master (ellswift, musig) and upcoming ones (silentpayments, see #1765).\r\n\r\nOne drawback is that the public API function `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_serialize` is now slightly more complex (we now call one of two functions instead of a single one, depending on whether the compressed flag is set or not), but that should hopefully not be a problem.\r\n\r\nThe commits are intentionally kept small to ease review, happy to squash them if that is preferred.\r\n\r\n(Kudos to w0xlt for the initial idea (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1765#pullrequestreview-3462461331) and to real-or-random for the suggestion to split the already existing function (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1773#issuecomment-3540461718).)",
