In practice, all existing code paths are _guaranteed_ (because the veirifcation of magnitudes is static and conservative) to never result in a having magnitude 8.\n\nSo the 'bug' could be fixed by just declaring that fe_sqrt takes an argument with magnitude at most 6 (which is already the case in practice).\n",

      "body": "@peterdettman @sipa After reviewing all the code I do not see any error in the magnitude requirements, or a failure to enforce (except one:.  I did notice that fe_verify imposed no upper limit on the magnitude at all, which is incorrect, so I added a commit with a limit.\n\nI concluded that the input to the square can be up to magnitude 8 and give correct results (it's only ever an input to sqr(), to add() with another input of magnitude 1, and the equal). secp256k1_fe_equal_var()'s first input must be magnitude 1 and this is checked by the negate inside it, which always run, and the second input can be magnitude whatever (well, up to 31, which is where the add would overflow for 10x26; which (with my second commit) is tested by the fe_verify inside the add, which is always executed).\n\nThe above is based on an understanding that fe_normalizes_to_zero_var works correctly for any magnitude that fits in the fe over-complete representation. If that isn't true, someone should rescue me from a grave misunderstanding about how all this works, and we should add a VERIFY test to the function that checks the actual requirement.\n\nAs far as enforcing contracts goes, what I think we generally want to do is perform the magnitude tests in verifies at the lowest possible level. E.g. nowhere but inside fe_verify or in special operations like the field specific fe_mul and fe_sqr that have their own internal magnitude requirements. Keeping the tests at the lowest levels make them more likely to be correct regardless of what field we're running on, and they're also where the magnitudes must be updated. HOWEVER, if an execution path of higher level code is non-deterministic, we may want to bubble up the worst case normalization path requirement and enforce it unconditionally. We have some code paths that execute with probability less than 2^-128 (and where constructing a test case is cryptographically hard), so we would never know if those paths overflow unless we manually bubble up the requirement. Fortunately the coverage tests I've been running will help catch if we make a mistake in failing to bubble up a requirement for code we don't know how to hit.\n\nBubbling up presents a problem that the low level requirements differ based on the field in use, which means layering violations (e.g. explicit magnitude tests inside group logic), which it would be preferable to avoid.\n",
