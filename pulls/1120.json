The computation just wastes time.\r\n\r\nPreviously, users could avoid this computation at least by asking for\r\na context without signing capabilities. But since 3b0c218 we always\r\nbuild an ecmult_gen context, ignoring the context flags. Moreover,\r\nusers could never avoid this pointless computation when asking for\r\nthe creation of a signing context.\r\n\r\nThis fixes one item in #1065.",

          "body": "Consolidating discussion from #385 #386 #387. Tobin is proposing to re-randomize contexts, not just the global one, when they are created -- though naturally only if the `rand` feature is enabled. Our current situation is kinda weird -- for users of global contexts, we require they \"opt out\" of rerandomization by choosing the `global-context-less-secure` feature vs the `global-context` flag, while ordinary users must \"opt in\" by creating a context then explicitly calling `randomize()` on it.\r\n\r\nA bit of context (hah):\r\n* re-randomization is not free: it takes about as long as a signing operation (around 50us on a desktop computer)\r\n* on the other hand, context generation is extremely expensive (multiple milliseconds on a desktop computer) so this is fine during context creation; but on the third hand, now that we are moving toward pre-computing all the tables, context creation will be nearly free, so the re-randomization would then be the bulk of the \"create context\" operation\r\n* re-randomization of verification contexts is a no-op. This discussion is only about signing contexts\r\n\r\nHere is my proposal:\r\n1. We remove the `global-context-less-secure` feature; `global-context` enables the global context, and we rerandomize it on first use if `rand` is also enabled.\r\n2. Similarly we randomize **all** signing contexts on creation, if `rand` is enabled\r\n3. We also change `sign()` and `sign_schnorr` to rerandomize the context after each signing operation. We add a `sign_no_rerandomize` method to opt out of this\r\n   1. This would nearly double signing time, **although** sipa points out that there is a theoretical way, with help from upstream, we could make the rerandomization 99%+ faster, by essentially only doing one bit of re-randomization per signature\r\n   2. This would also force the signing API to take a `&mut` pointer to the context object, which really sucks.\r\n3. We leave the `rerandomize()` methods in place but document that users have basically no reason to call them manually.\r\n\r\nAlternate proposals:\r\n* Leave the `sign` methods alone but add `sign_randomize` ones which also do the re-randomization\r\n* Embed a mutex in our `Context` objects so that re-randomization can be done with normal non-mutable references. (May be OK with \"fast re-randomization\", almost certainly not with full re-randomization, which would basically cause parallel signing operations to be force-serialized.)\r\n\r\ncc @TheBlueMatt @tcharding\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/881 (which is not the \"one-bit rerandomization\" idea, but is similar and has a similar effect).\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1058 which will affect upstream's blinding logic.",

It currently computes fixed values which could be made static (open PR: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1120)\r\n- [ ] Document (or set by default) build options to remove unused static tables (and code) when no signing/verification function is called (something like `--disable-shared CFLAGS=\"-fdata-sections -ffunction-sections -O2 -g\" LDFLAGS=\"-Wl,--gc-sections\"`)\r\n- [x] Document the backwards-compatible API changes made in #988 and in #956: All contexts except the `no_precomp` context are now effectively signing contexts. The `no_precomp` context is effectively a verification context., and name is misleading as no context uses dynamic precompuation now. The reason why `no_precomp` is different is that it's impossible to re-randomize it.\r\n- [x] Decide what to do with the `no_precomp` context: Possibilities include: renaming it, deprecating it (its main user rust-secp256k1 won't like this), and/or promote it a full signing context, maybe with a verbose name such as \"global-context-less-secure\" in the spirit of what rust-secp256k1 is doing.   \r\n   ",

Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",

I refrained from linking to the PR as the template proposed for multiple reasons:\r\n - Including the PR title is not in line with the suggestions in https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/ What they do instead is really just describe what parts in the API have changed, and I tend to agree that this is better for the user. The PR title can be rather technical or saying not too much, and a PR can correspond to multiple changes (for example this PR).\r\n - I'd be open to Include a link to the PR but I feel it's a little bit annoying because you get the PR number only after creating the PR... Also I think the changelog is addressed to our users, not our devs. It should be just a log of user-visible changes (syntax and visible API behavior), so we anyway shouldn't include every PR. \r\n\r\nA normal strategy would be to create a release first, then make the API changes, but in this case, this would be somewhat confusing. The important thing here is the changes made to context flags and these are already for quite some time, so it makes sense to document these even for the initial release.",
