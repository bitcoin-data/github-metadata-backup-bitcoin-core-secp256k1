A while back there was some odd breakage in the -DDETERMINISTIC build that turned out to be caused by the fact that it replaced the default CFLAGS with its own, meaning that instead of being built with \"-O3 -g\" by default, everything was built with the compiler's default (-O0).\n\nSince that's somewhat useful to have in the matrix, I've separated the two conditions by adding separate builds for the -DDETERMINISTIC and -O0 cases.\n",
