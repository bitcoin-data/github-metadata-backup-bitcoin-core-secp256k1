    "body": "built on top of c4942d36.\r\n\r\n> BIP352 requires senders to compute output scripts using ECDH shared secrets from the same secret keys used to sign the inputs. Generating an incorrect signature will produce an invalid transaction that will be rejected by consensus. An incorrectly generated output script can still be consensus-valid, meaning funds may be lost if it gets broadcast. By producing a DLEQ proof for the generated ECDH shared secrets, the signing entity can prove to other entities that the output scripts have been generated correctly without revealing the private keys.\r\n\r\n(from [BIP 374](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0374.mediawiki))\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n- adds support for DLEQ proof generation and verification using `secp256k1_dleq_prove`, `secp256k1_dleq_verify` based on implementation in [secp256k1-zkp](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp/blob/master/src/modules/ecdsa_adaptor/dleq_impl.h)\r\n- introduces a new structure for storing proofs in silent payment module - `secp256k1_silentpayments_dleq_data` which stores the shared secret computed using ECDH, DLEQ proof and also the index of which recipient in the [original unsorted recipient array](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/f42e0dde59943ad0c9247c61f7af521b70838e8f/include/secp256k1_silentpayments.h#L43)  the proof refers to.\r\n- adds 4 new APIs in silent payments module to create, verify, serialize and parse proof\r\n    1. sender can create proof using `secp256k1_silentpayments_sender_create_outputs_with_proof`\r\n        - in the existing `secp256k1_silentpayments_sender_create_outputs` API, output pubkey is created by iterating over all the recipients and computing ECDH for each unique recipient.\r\n        - since creating the proof also requites iterating over all recipients and computing ECDH for each unique recipient, compute both proof(s) and output pubkey(s) in a new function - `secp256k1_silentpayments_sender_create_outputs_with_proof`.\r\n        - `secp256k1_silentpayments_sender_create_outputs` can use `secp256k1_silentpayments_sender_create_outputs_with_proof`internally.\r\n    2.  both sender and receiver can verify proof using `secp256k1_silentpayments_verify_proof`\r\n    3. Serialisation function (`secp256k1_silentpayments_dleq_data_serialize`) serialises  `secp256k1_silentpayments_dleq_data` structure into bytes. `secp256k1_silentpayments_dleq_data_parse` parses the bytes back into `secp256k1_silentpayments_dleq_data` structure.\r\n        1. useful if proof creation is done on 1 sender side device (ex: hardware wallet) and proof verification is done on another sender side device (ex: software wallet). `secp256k1_silentpayments_dleq_data` structure can be serialised into bytes using `secp256k1_silentpayments_dleq_data_serialize` and then the bytes can be sent from 1 device to another.\r\n        2. `secp256k1_silentpayments_dleq_data_parse` can reconstruct the bytes back into `secp256k1_silentpayments_dleq_data` structure which can then be used for proof verification.\r\n\r\nopen questions:\r\n\r\n1. is the API design ok?\r\n    1. see `examples/silentpayments.c` for 2 scenarios in which proof verification could be useful. (Alice sends bitcoins to Bob and Carol in 1 silent payment transaction)\r\n        1. useful situation - On Alice’s side\r\n            1. Alice’s hardware wallet creates proof\r\n            2. Alice’s hardware wallet sends proof to Alice’s software wallet\r\n            3. Alice’s software wallet verifies proof and makes sure ECDH shared secrets for generating SP output is computed correctly. Alice can get additional safety guarantee about computed SP output before sending funds.\r\n        2. not sure if this situation is useful - On Bob’s/Carol’s side\r\n            1. Alice’s software wallet sends proof to Bob’s/Carol’s  software wallet\r\n            2. Bob’s/Carol’s software wallet verifies proof and makes sure ECDH shared secrets for generating SP output is computed correctly.\r\n2. should this be shipped with SP module or separately? only problem with separate release would be redundant APIs like `secp256k1_silentpayments_sender_create_outputs` and `secp256k1_silentpayments_sender_create_outputs_with_proof` for backward compatibility. \r\n\r\nHuge thanks to @ theStack for brainstorming and discussing this with me! ❤️",

I only briefly looked at the module, so all commentary here is very high level. Regarding shipping with the silent payments module, I don't see any reason to couple the two. Rather, I would consider the silent payments module a client of the DLEQ module.\r\n\r\n> only problem with separate release would be redundant APIs like `secp256k1_silentpayments_sender_create_outputs` and `secp256k1_silentpayments_sender_create_outputs_with_proof`\r\n\r\nI don't see this as a problem. An alternative to this would be to extend `create_outputs` with an unused out param in anticipation of the proof, but I much prefer what you have here with `create_outputs_with_proof`. There will also still be use cases where computing the proof is unnecessary (e.g., single party sender where sender has full access to the private keys) and I think two separate functions in the API is clearer than a single function with an optional output parameter.\r\n\r\n> not sure if this situation is useful - On Bob’s/Carol’s side\r\nAlice’s software wallet sends proof to Bob’s/Carol’s software wallet\r\nBob’s/Carol’s software wallet verifies proof and makes sure ECDH shared secrets for generating SP output is computed correctly.\r\n\r\nI haven't thought this all the way through, but I believe this could function as a proof of payment. Imagine Alice has paid Bob and wants to prove this to a 3rd party. Alice could compute the DLEQ proof and then pass this with the along with the shared secret to the 3rd party, who can then verify the DLEQ proof and use the shared secret to verify that the the SP output is present in the transaction. All this to say, I think having an example of this would be helpful! \r\n",

I'm not actively addressing comments in this SP+DLEQ PR since it depends on SP and would like to look at it first.\r\n\r\n(sorry for the confusion! will review #1802!)",
