    "body": "This enables a libsecp256k1_jni shared lib to be built. It depends on libsecp256k1.\n\n`./configure --enable-jni` should be all it takes assuming your java environment is setup properly. For now, there's no way to specify where the includes should be found if they're not located in $JAVA_HOME/include, as I'm not sure if that's necessary or not.\n\nNotice that the lib has been renamed in the .java to reflect the lib's new name. This was done to match standard distro packaging names.\n\nThis is untested in a real java/jni build, verification that it actually works will be needed before merging.\n",

      "description": "Motivation: libsecp is already widely used today, but often in a terribly outdated version. It's likely that a release process would help with that. Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",

I gave it a try and ran into two issues..\n\n1) I see a configure: error jni.h not found at C:/Progra~1/Java/jdk1.7.0_02/include/ which is actually the correct path. I believe just the check is wrong because if I remove this line from the configure file it proceeds to issue 2.\n\n2) the jni.h header refers to a jni_md.h file which is not in the /include folder by default, it needs to be added as a second include path. This folder is different depending on enviroment. For windows, the include is found in java_home/include/win32 and linux is java_home/include/linux. (A bootleg check might be to simply add a new path to whatever folder is found inside /include. \n\nI changed the make file just to see if it would work and put:\nJNI_INCLUDES = -IC:/Progra~1/Java/jdk1.7.0_02/include -IC:/Progra~1/Java/jdk1.7.0_02/include/win32\n\nAfter that, the make succeeds and I see a .lo file created, but not an .so. Is there another step to create the shared library out of the library object file?\n",

Assuming the functions reachable from jni are stable (sign+verify), the jni lib would hardly ever need to change, and could be packaged with java apps easily.

While working on this I noticed the JNI coverage of the library is lacking (only supporting ecdsa_verify); I didn't dig far enough to understand the intent of the original committer, but if keeping the JNI bindings upstream is the long-term intent, then I'd be interested in expanding the code coverage to include the rest of the secp256k1 API, including testcases, as well. \n\nI think there's quite a bit of value in that, but I don't want to get in the way of your impending changes, so if you pushed a WIP branch up sometime I could probably work with your changes in parallel.\n",

About statics:\n\nStatic fields in Java aren't GC'ed until the class is unloaded or the classloader is unloaded, so the option for that is to move from static methods to a object-instantiation based approach, which would increase the complexity, for about 8 bytes of memory (java longs are 64 bit)- If its wanted I can look into doing this definitely, but I'm unsure if the added complexity would make the trade-off worthwhile.\n",

As-is, I believe big-endian is broken.\n\nSo that would make this:\n\n``` c\nJNIEXPORT jint JNICALL Java_org_bitcoin_NativeSecp256k1_secp256k1_1ecdsa_1verify\n  (JNIEnv* env, jclass classObject, jobject byteBufferObject, jlong ctx_l)\n{\n        secp256k1_context_t *ctx = (secp256k1_context_t*)ctx_l;\n\n       unsigned char* data = (unsigned char*) (*env)->GetDirectBufferAddress(env, byteBufferObject);\n       int sigLen = *((int*)(data + 32));\n       int pubLen = *((int*)(data + 32 + 4));\n```\n\nlook more like this:\n\n```\nJNIEXPORT jint JNICALL Java_org_bitcoin_NativeSecp256k1_secp256k1_1ecdsa_1verify\n  (JNIEnv* env, jclass classObject, jobject byteBufferObject, jlong ctx_l, jint sigLen, jint pubLen)\n{\n       secp256k1_context_t *ctx = (secp256k1_context_t*)ctx_l;\n\n       unsigned char* data = (unsigned char*) (*env)->GetDirectBufferAddress(env, byteBufferObject);\n```\n\nObviously the function signature would have to be fixed up.\n\nThoughts?\n",

      "body": "@theuni Hey, I'm curious where you might be seeing platform-specific broken-ness... I would have thought this line in the Java code `byteBuff.order(ByteOrder.nativeOrder());` would have appropriately detected endian-ness, am I missing something? Although, if you just prefer to have a more explicit function sig, I definitely think it looks better from a API perspective *and definitely can fix that up\n\nI'm also pretty interested in checking endianness on a VM or via qemu, but I totally can understand if you think thats a tangent here :) \n\nInterested to know more, I havent' dealt too heavily with platform-specific endianness issues in the past, and know how important they are to handle in this piece of code.\n",

I think that with the code we have in place it should be pretty safe (and i feel fairly confident) in bringing these to JNI (perhaps with additional tests as well) - thoughts there? \n\n```\n    secp256k1_ec_pubkey_decompress\n    secp256k1_ec_privkey_export\n    secp256k1_ec_privkey_import\n    secp256k1_ecdsa_sign_compact\n    secp256k1_ecdsa_recover_compact\n```\n\nPerhaps also `randomize()` but that would entail synchronization safety, which could be a good thing to have anyway\n",

Since you're doing the bulk of the work here now, how about adding the above (though you don't have to of course, it's fine as-is), then opening a new PR for fresh review?\n\nI only have 2 complaints left, I believe. It'd be great if you could address them as you work on the other changes:\n- tabs->spaces. Lots of tabs snuck in with your changes, please make sure that whitespace matches the rest of the codebase.\n- On the native side of the JNI functions, there are several places where `ret` is ignored after library calls. Even if those should realistically never fail, there should still be a way to inform the Java side that they did.\n\nIf you're OK with it, at this point I'll close this PR and invite you re-open a fresh one when you're ready. You're welcome to squash down any of my stuff however it makes sense to you.\n",

I'll likely have time to work on this soon/tonight-ish, but I'll need to look into synch locking a bit more before committing anything- Sipa mentioned some really important failure modes that just got documented in the 'assumptions' thread, and I want to make sure we're good there. \n- Tabbing: Yup I noticed this a bit while working and its annoying, good to hear spaces is preferred as that is how my editor is setup so should be no problem\n- Ret: Yea this is an interesting one, I think handling this will make the Java side more of a proper native library (rather than a easy-to-use libsecp256k1) so I definitely see where that is going and will find some way to pass that through to the Java side.\n\nLets hold on closing the PR for the moment, I'll get those nits and funcs above addressed, and then when I open the new one, lets say we close this one *and continue the discussion there, ?\n\nSquashing OK\n",

When we talked on IRC I did not realize you were working on code to be merged into libsecp256k1 itself.\n\nAndrew\n",

The size difference and added attack surface are practically zero, so I'm not understanding the benefit.\n\nIf _jni was shared and depended on the main lib, I'd agree. But I'm not following you in the static case.\n",

      "body": "Well, in terms of expected usage, I think you either want the library itself (which offers the API described in the .h file), or you want something to plug into Java (which offers the API described by the .java file). I wasn't expecting one library that could function as both, but in practice there's probably very little benefit in splitting it up.\n\nOne alternative could be to have a different top-level .c file which implements the Java API, which may be different (and for now, would definitely just be a subset), but that's probably overkill as well.\n\nConcept ACK.\n",
