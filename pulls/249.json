      "body": "The code is correct.  The decompress function takes a pointer to an int; this pointer is derefernced before passing to the internal parse function.  The reason the decompress input is a pointer is because the length is an in/out field-- it gets updated with the new length after decompression.\n\n(As you can see from the travis results, this function is extensively tested and the change breaks the tests).\n\nI am guessing that the application code you are using is incorrectly passing in an integer (with type coercion to make it compile).\n",
