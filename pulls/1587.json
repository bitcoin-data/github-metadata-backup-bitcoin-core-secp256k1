It was added here: [#212 (files)](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/212/files#diff-6f71b0372be086d45b4f2740508c03a21835d87008840032fbb767f419fd988aR552)\r\n\r\nThe function was added for key aggregation in multi-signatures (predating MuSig(2)). Variable-time group addition was available back then.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the idea was that the individual keys to be aggregated are secrets. One can make that point (also in MuSig), but I think our current implicit policy is that only secret keys are secret when it comes to timing (and public keys are, well, public).\r\n\r\n> I'm aware that some implementations use `pubkey_combine` to add \"secret\" group elements in a \"blind DH\" (see [here](https://github.com/cashubtc/nutshell/blob/77ba35649993d229f5f01c2ab2cf66278884cd30/cashu/core/crypto/b_dhke.py), [here](https://github.com/cashubtc/nutshell/blob/77ba35649993d229f5f01c2ab2cf66278884cd30/cashu/core/crypto/secp.py#L7) and [here](https://github.com/cashubtc/cdk/blob/5f87df2cef71b97fac42419e97849335854743f4/crates/cdk/src/dhke.rs#L75)).

In any case, constant time addition is not something one can expect from libsecp's API (it's called \"**public** key combine\").\r\n\r\nHm, yeah. I suggest not bothering with these functions for now. I think our long-term plan is to deprecate them and replace them with a properly designed hazmat API (see for example https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1471#issuecomment-1967953283). No matter, if we'll do this in the future or not, it's not a big deal for performance if this function stays constant-time. ",

      "body": "> Hm, yeah. I suggest not bothering with these functions for now. I think our long-term plan is to deprecate them and replace them with a properly designed hazmat API (see for example [#1471 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1471#issuecomment-1967953283)). No matter, if we'll do this in the future or not, it's not a big deal for performance if this function stays constant-time.\r\n\r\nMakes sense! Closing this PR accordingly.",
