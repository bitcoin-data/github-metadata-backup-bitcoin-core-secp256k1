          "body": "The main commit comprises `905 insertions(+), 1253 deletions(-)`. The diff isn't as small as I had hoped, but that's mostly because it was possible to simplify the API quite substantially which required rewriting large parts. Sorry, almost all of the changes are in one big commit which makes the diff very hard to read. Perhaps best to re-review most parts from scratch.\r\n\r\nA few key changes:\r\n\r\n- Obviously no commitment round. No big session struct and no `verifier` sessions. No `signer` struct.\r\n- There's a new `secnonce` struct that is the output of musig_nonce_gen and derived from a uniformly random session_id32. The derivation can be strengthened by adding whatever session parameters (combined_pk, msg) are available. The nonce function is my ad-hoc construction that allows for these optional inputs. Please have a look at that.\r\n- The secnonce is made invalid after being used in partial_sign.\r\n- Adaptor signatures basically work as before, according to https://github.com/ElementsProject/scriptless-scripts/pull/24 (with the exception that they operate on aggregate instead of partial sigs)\r\n- To avoid making this PR overly complex I did not consider how this implementation interacts with nested-MuSig, sign-to-contract, and antiklepto.\r\n- Testing should be close to complete. There's no reachable line or branch that isn't exercised by the tests.\r\n- [x] ~In the current implementation when a signer sends an invalid nonce (i.e. some garbage that can't be mapped to a group element), it is ignored when combining nonces. Only after receiving the signers partial signature and running `partial_sig_verify` will we notice that the signer misbehaved. The reason for this is that 1) this makes the API simpler and 2) malicious peers don't gain any additional powers because they can always interrupt the protocol by refusing to sign. However, this is up for discussion.~ EDIT: this is not the case anymore since invalid nonces are rejected when they're parsed.\r\n- [x] ~For every partial signature we verify we have to parse the pubnonce (two compressed points), despite having parsed it in `process_nonces` already. This is not great. `process_nonces` could optionally output the array of parsed pubnonces.~ EDIT: fixed by having a dedicated type for nonces.\r\n- [x] ~I left `src/modules/musig/musig.md` unchanged for now. Perhaps we should merge it with the `musig-spec`~ EDIT: musig.md is updated\r\n- [x] partial verification should use multiexp to compute `R1 + b*R2 + c*P`, but this can be done in a separate PR\r\n- [x] renaming wishlist\r\n    - pre_session -> keyagg_cache (because there is no session anymore)\r\n    - pubkey_combine, nonce_combine, partial_sig_combine -> pubkey_agg, nonce_agg, partial_sig_agg (shorter, matches terminology in musig2)\r\n    - musig_session_init -> musig_start (shorter, simpler) or [musig_generate_nonce](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/pull/131#discussion_r654190890) or musig_prepare\r\n    - musig_partial_signature to musig_partial_sig (shorter)\r\n- [x] perhaps remove pubnonces and n_pubnonces argument from process_nonces (and then also add a opaque type for the combined nonce?)\r\n- [x] write the `combined_pubkey` into the `pre_session` struct (as suggested [below](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/pull/131#issuecomment-866904975): then 1) session_init and process_nonces don't need a combined_pk argument (and there can't be mix up between tweaked and untweaked keys) and 2) pubkey_tweak doesn't need an input_pubkey and the output_pubkey can be written directly into the pre_session (reducing frustration such as Replace MuSig(1) module with MuSig2 #131 (comment))\r\n- [x] perhaps allow adapting both partial sigs (`partial_sig` struct) and aggregate partial sigs (64 raw bytes) as suggested [below](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/pull/131#issuecomment-867281531).\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on #120.\r\n\r\n",
