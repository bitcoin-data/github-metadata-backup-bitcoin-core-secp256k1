      "body": "> The array-as-a-param makes this annoying because `sizeof(l)` is not helpful.\r\n\r\nHm, yeah, idk, the `uint64_t l[8]` parameter declaration is a bit strange, or at least unusual for this code base. I'd ACK a patch that changes this a pointer declaration, which we usually do in the codebase. If you do, maybe also rename to `l8`.\r\n\r\nFor others: The issue is that, despite the declaration, `l` will still decay to a pointer, i.e., `l` won't be of array type, but of type `uint64_t*`. And the `[8]` has no significance.  That means that `sizeof(l) == sizeof(uint64_t*)`, which, for maximum confusion, happens to be 8 coincidentally.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/05bfab69aef3622f77f754cfb01220108a109c91/src/scalar_4x64_impl.h#L684",
