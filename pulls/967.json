      "body": "So to give an idea of the status here:\r\n* The code works, is generally a speedup, and is unlikely to change much; if it does, it's probably restricted to just better asm code\r\n* There is an issue on macOS to figure out (linking fails; I wonder if the asm/linker detect platform-specific instructions, and need some kind of magic runtime detection annotation?)\r\n* As is, this PR removes the old 5x52 representation. That may be undesirable, as at least on some (uncommon) platforms, the new code is (slightly) slower. This may be even more the case with #810 merged now.\r\n* It's an open question how this is supposed to be reviewed or otherwise gained confidence in. I know there are formal methods of proving semantics of asm code, but I don't have experience with them. An alternative is adding lots of high-level description to the asm code to make it readable.\r\n* This PR leaves the decision on which repr/impl to use up to the `./configure` step. That's useful in some settings, and enough to enable testing, but not what we want for normal production usage. I'm fine with that, but perhaps people want a clearer plan on how runtime autodetection etc would work before proceeding?",

          "body": "Right now, it is not exactly clear where the definition of magnitude/normalization rules belongs:\r\n* On the one hand, both implementations individually track these values separately (and have their own rules)\r\n* On the other hand, callers of the field code are expected to simultaneously satisfy all of them.\r\n\r\nWith #967 things may become even more complicated as it adds a \"precomputed\" dimension (=reduced to 4 64-bit limbs instead of 5), but lacks the need for magnitudes as a concern.\r\n\r\nSo I think that we should make these rules part of the generic field interface, rather than part of the implementations. To avoid duplication, there could be a field_debug.h that implements these by \"wrapping\" the underlying field. It could be done by giving all field types/functions a suffix, and if debug is in use, have the real field functions forward to those, and if not, just `#define fn fn_suffix` for all.\r\n\r\nOne reason for not doing this would be if we want to make group logic dependent on what the used field is (e.g. a field with laxer magnitude requirements could result in the group code emitting fewer normalization calls).",

I believe that is undesirable, as these properties should purely be a function of the performed fe_ functions, and not of the choice of field implementation. This becomes even uglier with #967, which would copy all that, and even needs an additional dimension that would then need to be added to the two other fields. It's also related to #1001, which I think will become easier if it doesn't need to be done/reasoned about separately for every field.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves all logic around these fields (collectively called field verification) to implementations in field_impl.h, which dispatch to renamed functions in field_*_impl.h for the actual implementation.\r\n\r\nFixes #1060.",

Since the current output of CryptOpt is not fully generic x86_64 asm, we need either of these two: \r\n   - [ ] Add CPU id on our side\r\n   - [ ] Modify CryptOpt so that it uses only instructions available on all x86_64 CPUs    ",
