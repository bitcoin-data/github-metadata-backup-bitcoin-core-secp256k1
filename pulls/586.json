Assuming the 1.8% number applies on ARM, that change is essentially 1-2 hours of additional sync time on a non-assumevalid initial sync on a small bitcoin node.\r\n\r\nHere is my reasoning: There are a significant number of optimizations in the codebase with 1% - 3% level improvements which could be excluded on the basis of \"maybe they get miscompiled\" or \"maybe they have a bug\".\r\n\r\nIf the tests (including run time self tests) aren't adequate to catch all plausible miscompilation,  we should improve them.  This has an added benefit of also protecting the code against unforseen risks, something that avoiding long standing language features does not accomplish.\r\n\r\nOr, if 1% vs the level of risk that using a less common compiler annotation implies is really the trade-off we want to take we should probably remove all the distinct normalization cases (and replace all with the a single constant time full normalization), the R comparison in projective space optimization, x86_64 assembly (which is now not much faster than what the compiler can produce), effective affine, etc.  Each of which has 1-2% performance impacts and arguably has a worse risk/performance trade-off than the use of restrict. Similarly, under that logic we should probably remove endomorphism and gmp support from the codebase (zero performance gain in the normal config,  non-zero risk of introducing bugs in the normal configuration).  \r\n\r\nI don't actually think the above is a good idea: I think our principle before has been to include essentially any optimization-- even relatively complex ones-- which would make a measurable difference in a real system subject to the constraint that we could test it well enough to be reasonably confident that its safe.   But since there is essentially no competing library for this curve which I'm aware of which is anywhere near as fast, I think a case could be made for simplifying the codebase until it is merely significantly faster than the next less-well-tested alternative. To the extent that safety is our primary goal we only need to be fast enough to ensure that users who mostly care about speed select this code over a less safe alternative. [also, the audience of embedded devices that frequently adopt obviously less safe code might be swayed by a smaller binary sizes...]\r\n\r\nBut whatever we do, we should try to be intentional and consistent in our strategy so that we get the full benefit of it.\r\n\r\nI also think that a case could be made for doing this if it were shown that the slowdown didn't happen on ARM (since that's where a performance loss is especially critical), or as a temporary measure while tests were improved.",

This library offers exceptional quality due to\r\n - careful programming,\r\n - careful review, and\r\n - good tests.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the first two bullets don't help in case of miscompilation. Tests do help of course but tests rarely show the absence of bugs. Another concern is that compilers behave differently on different architectures, with different versions, different flags, etc,  and it's not clear if people run the tests every time after they compile the code. \r\n\r\nAnd sure, other code can be miscompiled, too. But without a specific bug in mind, there is no reason why a specific implementation (say projective space stuff) should be more prone to miscompilation than other, except that it uses more lines of code. \r\n\r\nIn our case, we know that these specific compiler bugs just won't happen if we disable restrict. The scope of the compiler bug is quite narrow and we know what to do to prevent it, and we know the slowdown.\r\n\r\nIf gcc released a new flag `-finline-experimental-1.8` with the description \"speeds up your code by 1.8 % but we've seen cases of miscompilation\", would you enable it in secp if the tests pass? I wouldn't.",

It is a justification for runtime self-tests.  I agree that the concern that the tests aren't getting run where they need to be run is a good one, but the answer to it isn't not to make a particular tradeoff one way for one thing, the answer is to fix the underlying.\r\n\r\nAgain, I still hold that this particular decision doesn't carry unique risks compared to a dozen other choices, nor do I think a case has been made that it has a worse trade-off.\r\n\r\n> And sure, other code can be miscompiled, too. But without a specific bug in mind, there is no reason why a specific implementation (say projective space stuff) should be more prone to miscompilation than other, \r\n\r\nIf you really want, I can go and justify the other examples in light of prior miscomplation bugs specifically, but I think it would be a waste of time.  Besides, \"except that it uses more lines of code\" is a perfectly fine justification on its own. (not more lines precisely but more total machine code with more total corner cases)\r\n\r\n> If gcc released a new flag -finline-experimental-1.8 with the description \"speeds up your code by 1.8 % but we've seen cases of miscompilation\r\n\r\nThe \"new\" kind of confuses the issue-- anything new also carries a higher degree of unknown unknowns--, but we certainly compile with optimizations and there is a long and illustrious history of compiler optimizations and miscompilation. The benefit is (presumably!) more than 1.8% but the risk, historically, is that there have been a tremendous number of miscomplations which were optimization linked.\r\n\r\nGCC's bug tracker is filled with _scads_ of reports of miscompilation both current and in recent history (some even reported by some of us in the past...).  But no attention is being given to that, only to this one thing that someone noticed.   This seems to me to be a reactionary response ungrounded in a systematic approach to managing the tradeoffs of software quality.\r\n",

      "body": "> As an aside, the linked GCC misbehaviour only occurs with -O3 (the same applies to the similar behaviour in LLVM) ... which fits nicely with my above comment about optimization. I'd find an argument to not use O3 in general to be more compelling...\r\n\r\nNow that we switched to O2, I hoped that this issue had been resolved on the way. But apparently, the miscompilation of the example program from the GCC bug only disappears on GCC, where it's fixed anyway in the most recent versions. Clang/LLVM does loop unrolling even with O2, so you additionally need `-fno-unroll-loops` (https://godbolt.org/z/urkkWD), which seems to have some performance impact at least if x86_64 asm is disabled (gmp does not make a big difference). \r\n\r\n```\r\n./configure --with-bignum=gmp --with-asm=x86_64 CC=clang CFLAGS=-fno-unroll-loops\r\necdsa_verify: min 81.3us / avg 83.4us / max 85.6us\r\necdsa_verify: min 81.9us / avg 82.9us / max 84.3us\r\n\r\n./configure --with-bignum=gmp --with-asm=x86_64 CC=clang CFLAGS= \r\necdsa_verify: min 81.4us / avg 83.7us / max 86.5us\r\necdsa_verify: min 81.4us / avg 83.1us / max 87.0us\r\n\r\n./configure --with-bignum=no --with-asm=no CC=clang CFLAGS= \r\necdsa_verify: min 97.1us / avg 98.6us / max 100us\r\n\r\n./configure --with-bignum=no --with-asm=no CC=clang CFLAGS=-fno-unroll-loops\r\necdsa_verify: min 95.9us / avg 101us / max 104us\r\n```\r\n500000 runs each.\r\n\r\nI'm not a friend of tweaking flags too much but given that there are anyway performance differences between gcc and clang and we unrolling is disabled in gcc, I could indeed imagine adding `-fno-unroll-loops` if other can confirm my benchmarks.",
