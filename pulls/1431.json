It also updates the README very slightly.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I added some coding conventions that I remembered explaining to new contributors in the past year. Even though it's far from exhaustive, I think this is an easy improvement to the CONTRIBUTING.md. Feel free to suggest more conventions.",

For this reason, do not mix any formatting fixes or code moves with actual code changes. Make sure each individual commit is hygienic: that it builds successfully on its own without warnings, errors, regressions, or test failures.\n+- Use `void *ptr` instead of `void* ptr`.\n+- Avoid trailing whitespaces.\n+\n+### Tests\n+\n+#### Coverage\n+\n+This library aims to have full coverage of the reachable lines and branches.\n+\n+To create a test coverage report, configure with `--enable-coverage` (use of GCC is necessary):\n+\n+    $ ./configure --enable-coverage\n+\n+Run the tests:\n+\n+    $ make check\n+\n+To create a report, `gcovr` is recommended, as it includes branch coverage reporting:\n+\n+    $ gcovr --exclude 'src/bench*' --print-summary\n+\n+To create a HTML report with coloured and annotated source code:\n+\n+    $ mkdir -p coverage\n+    $ gcovr --exclude 'src/bench*' --html --html-details -o coverage/coverage.html\n+\n+#### Exhaustive Tests\n+\n+There are tests of several functions in which a small group replaces secp256k1.\n+These tests are *exhaustive* since they provide all elements and scalars of the small group as input arguments (see [src/tests_exhaustive.c]).\n+\n+",

      "body": "(I may be quite nitpicky here, but I think this line is rather important because it should become our new  \"short description\"  as often included by package managers and also presented at the right-hand side of the GitHub page.)\r\n\r\nI think \"other schemes\" is a bit strange because \"digital signatures\" is not a scheme. It's a \"cryptographic primitive\". That word is a bit uncommon outside academia, but I think it's okay.\r\n\r\nI very much like the wording in the new file: \"libsecp256k1 is a library for elliptic curve cryptography\". But yeah, it may still make sense to mention signatures. Here are a few suggestions:\r\n\r\n - Optimized C library for digital signatures and other cryptographic primitives on elliptic curve secp256k1\r\n - Optimized C library for digital signatures and other cryptography on elliptic curve secp256k1\r\n - Optimized C library for elliptic curve cryptography (incl. digital signatures) on curve secp256k1\r\n - Optimized C library for elliptic curve cryptography on curve secp256k1, with a focus on the Bitcoin ecosystem\r\n\r\nIndependently, I suggest dropping \"Optimized\"... It's not wrong, but I think it made sense when the library was created because performance was by far the main feature. Today, it's rather a combination of performance and assurance. We could call it \"high-performance high-assurance\" but I want others to judge this. (Also, it sounds like [stolen from djb](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/ed25519-20110705.pdf), and it just makes the description longer.)\r\n",

For this reason, do not mix any formatting fixes or code moves with actual code changes. Make sure each individual commit is hygienic: that it builds successfully on its own without warnings, errors, regressions, or test failures.\n+- Use `void *ptr` instead of `void* ptr`.\n+- Avoid trailing whitespaces.\n+\n+### Tests\n+\n+#### Coverage\n+\n+This library aims to have full coverage of the reachable lines and branches.\n+\n+To create a test coverage report, configure with `--enable-coverage` (use of GCC is necessary):\n+\n+    $ ./configure --enable-coverage\n+\n+Run the tests:\n+\n+    $ make check\n+\n+To create a report, `gcovr` is recommended, as it includes branch coverage reporting:\n+\n+    $ gcovr --exclude 'src/bench*' --print-summary\n+\n+To create a HTML report with coloured and annotated source code:\n+\n+    $ mkdir -p coverage\n+    $ gcovr --exclude 'src/bench*' --html --html-details -o coverage/coverage.html\n+\n+#### Exhaustive Tests\n+\n+There are tests of several functions in which a small group replaces secp256k1.\n+These tests are *exhaustive* since they provide all elements and scalars of the small group as input arguments (see [src/tests_exhaustive.c]).",
