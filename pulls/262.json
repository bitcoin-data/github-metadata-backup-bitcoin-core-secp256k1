    "body": "Builds on #252.\n\nThis is a demo of another isomorphism trick that I originally described here: http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/cfrg/current/msg05770.html .\n\nThis PR adds secp256k1_xo_multiply(), with test and benchmark (bench_ecdh_xo), plus a new group method secp256k1_ge_set_xo_iso_var() to support the central trick of getting a valid point from an x-coord without sqrt.\n\nThere are two main caveats:\n1. A Jacobi symbol test is required to validate the input. GMP has an appropriate method~~, but the call site is just a TODO in this current code. I would appreciate help in wiring that up if anyone wants to volunteer~~.\n2. The output is only an x-coord. The y-coord _could_ be recovered... at the cost of a sqrt! AFAIK there's no cheap way to get even the sign bit. Still, I think needing only the x-coord is a fairly common use case, though I don't know if/how bitcoin uses ECDH.\n\nNOTE: The input is currently also just a field element, but it could perhaps be a point, with this optimization only applied if it is in compressed format.\n\nI measure an 8.5% performance improvement for bench_ecdh_xo vs bench_ecdh. The final numbers will depend mostly on how expensive the Jacobi symbol test is, but it should be considerably cheaper than the sqrt.\n",

      "body": "So, there are a  bunch of related questions here:\n- Do we want a specific ECDH implementation, or do we want EC point-scalar multiplication?\n  - For ECDH, we could have \"hash of full serialized point\", \"hash of x coordinate\" or \"just x coordinate\". I wouldn't want more than one, though.\n  - EC point-scalar multiplication is much more general, and I wouldn't mind having an X-only version as well as an XY version, if there is a significant gain.\n\nI also don't like relying on GMP for an extra operation. At least for the mpz_mod_inverse we can (and should!) do a verification whether the inverse is correct using our implementation. Is something similar possible with mpz_jacobi?\n\nAlpha is using the hash(full point) mechanism currently, though the X-only approach for ECDH does feel a bit cleaner, so I'm fine with only having that approach in the main code if it's considered better.\n",

      "body": "@peterdettman one could sort the pubkeys but alas, that doesn't always work.  I don't know ultimately but we should try to think it through.\n\nIn general we've tried to avoid offering just \"raw primitives\" instead of complete cryptography protocols for a couple reasons--\n\nOne is that the API becomes something you're committed to maintaining, e.g. say we offered a raw ECDH but then found a nice fast x-only, then end up maintaining having to maintain code for both because people were using the old API because they expected the Y.  Or we found some performance optimization, e.g. imagine if our ECDH verify returned the recovered r value and expected the caller to to do the comparison.\n\nWe've seen OpenSSL end up having to carry around a lot of buggy additional code because it didn't really have an external interface but exposed most of its internals to the outside world then had to maintain them.\n\nAnother is that we know from experience that more low level exposure is more opportunity to misuse. Example: our old ECDSA directly took the k value, one user of the library decided to set k=privkey xor message (and then argued that it wasn't vulnerable; andytoshi had fun coming up with attacks for that construct).  Another example for ECDH which is  not an issue for secp256k1 but would be for some other curves is that a dumb protocol which spat out the ephemeral point directly could be used to leak data from subgroup confinement.  So basically, if there is a possible way to easily misuse an API a naive user to misuse an API we ought to have a good reason why we offered it anyways....  Or at least if there is something simply and safe that most people should want we should offer than in addition to the low level thing, just so they're not required to play with fire.\n\nAnother is performance relayed, if there is a generally interesting cryptosystem someone wants to implement with this curve, it should be done using the high speed internal functions not kludged together using the external API.\n\nSo these are just some considerations... perhaps returning the X value is the thing we really should do here-- I'm not sure--  but I do think that its easier to misuse-- as I said, I think I can easily construct contrived protocols where the malleability causes problems, and so I think it's worth giving some thought, even if our ultimate conclusion is that we can't improve things without making unfortunate tradeoffs.\n",

For example, what if we had an API that implemented simple point addition between two compressed points, but someone has to add 1 million points together. The naive way of doing so would be calling the 2-ary point addition 999999 times, but doing so would involve 999999 conversions to affine coordinates, killing performance. If there is a need for doing an addition of 1000000 points, there should be a high-level API that does so, and implements it in the most safe way possible.\n",

      "body": "> In general we've tried to avoid offering just \"raw primitives\" instead of complete cryptography protocols for a couple reasons\n\nThis is starting to look like a discussion of the overall aim and spirit of the library.  As someone who has written an [ECDSA implementation](https://github.com/DavidEGrayson/ruby_ecdsa) I thought I would chime in and give my two cents.\n\nI mainly think of secp256k1 as a mathematical object that has certain low-level operations: it has a generator point and an infinity point, you can add points, multiply points by numbers, negate points.  Each point has two coordinates, except for the infinity point.  ECDSA is just a handy thing that was built on top of this interesting elliptic curve.\n\nSo when I see a library called \"libsecp256k1\" with the tag line \"Optimized C library for EC operations on curve secp256k1.\", I just expect it to have those primitive operations in there.\n\nMy ECDSA implementation offers these primitive operations, and that is what allowed someone to build a [ring signature implementation](https://github.com/jamoes/ring_sig), using my work as a dependency.\n\nIf I didn't offer those operations, they would have to write code that depends on poorly documented internal functions in my library.  If I pull their work into my library, then I would have to maintain that code myself as my project progresses, which is more work than just maintaining the API they used.  If I don't pull it, then they would have the burden of maintaining a fork of my library. Either way, one of us would be in a position of maintaining code that they didn't write and aren't too interested in.\n\nTo address the safety issue, you could just document to the user which operations are safe for novices working on production systems, and which operations should be left to advanced users or users who are just playing around.  The advanced ones could even be in a separate header file.  Or perhaps you would break the project up into separate libraries that offer different classes of operations.\n\nTo address the particular example of adding up 1000000 points, you could offer an API that uses opaque pointers to optimized representations of points, instead of actually passing around binary blobs of data.\n",

      "body": "@DavidEGrayson I see your point, but I don't believe it is realistic. As optimizations evolve, internal data types will change, and the way they need to interact will change too. Exposing those for the purpose of simplifying work on top would incur a large maintenance cost, especially as those internal types are platform dependent, and properly hiding their implementation adds performance cost.\n\nFurthermore, I think it is ill-advised to encourage people to write constructs using low-level optimized unsafe but exposed functions. This is cryptographic code, and if you need access to low-level operations to implement something more efficiently, I think you should do the effort of understanding the internals anyway. The alternative probably has many risks for edge cases.\n",

That makes it hard to generate the same secret libsecp256k1 will use -- if you already have some data you can test both odd/even possibilities, but if you're sending and libsecp256k1 is receiving, you need to know in advance.\n\nSo I think an \"x\"-only implementation would be a win for compatability reasons (and if that could be the only option, that seems like it'd be even better)...\n",

In particular, secp256k1 is not a terribly popular curve and will be inherently incompatible with most things on that basis alone. Many defacto (and, in some cases, formalized) standards involve behavior we think may be (and/or have observed to be) gratuitously risky. For example, I'm sure we violate various DSA standards by using derandomized signing, not using SHA1, and providing signatures that pass a strong verifier.\n",

But the consequence \"there are two public keys you can give to someone such that they'll compute the same shared secret\" seems like the kind of subtle unexpected thing that people will forget in higher level cryptosystems.\n\nLike @gmaxwell suggested somewhere that maybe somebody would make a system that used an ECDH secret to seed an RNG which checked that it was never seeded with the same key twice (by just blacklisting every public key it had already received). Maybe for like a gambling site users could get predictable outcomes this way.\n\nThis is kinda contrived, because like why would the site blacklist the incoming public points instead of the computed secrets, but it illustrates my point that we don't want surprises. You could say of ECDSA \"why does it matter that (r, s) and (r, -s) are both valid signatures when you need to know the actual secret to compute one of them?\" and we've seen in Bitcoin that this is a malleability vector that prevents chaining together even fairly simple zero-conf transactions.\n",

(Why bother? Multiple independent implementations of new protocols seems to me like a good way to ensure they make sense, YMMV) Getting a compatible result to this library's ECDH was a pain due to the slightly abnormal inclusion of a bit from y. Changing the protocol to just use SHA256(x) would've made things easy in python w/ openssl, but a pain in the C version with this library (unless you guys decide to patch it of course! :). Having a python wrapper for this module would make the code easier, but would mean the implementations weren't particularly as independent as they could be...\n\nList thread is at http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2015-October/000248.html fwiw.\n",

      "body": "The issue is that it creates a malleable result, where two different points result in the same shared secret.  This general shape of issue is known to produce security vulnerabilities in other contexts (e.g. the inherent ecdsa malleability).\n\nWhile this won't produce an issue in _most_ contexts that we're aware of, this is a general primitive and we do not know how it will be used. I can construct a contrived example where this surprising property results in a vulnerability-- so I consider it a concern, if not a blocker, and we should be careful and thoughtful. \n\nContrived example: say you are building a smart contract bonded transaction processing system.  Participants are required by the protocol to never replay a specific message type (except if the whole input is identical).  The messages are encrypted and look like [ephemeral pubkey][ECIES(message, digital-signature-of-message)]. If a duplicate is created, someone can show the smart contract the two non-identical messages and the destination private key, allowing it to check that they are duplicates and if so releases the bond.  Someone sends you a message, you swap the pubkey for the equivalent one,  and send two-- now technically distinct-- messages to the contract and the private key.  Of course, this kind of thing can be avoided-- e.g. by requiring the keys to have a specified sign; but only by someone who understands and thinks of the issue. So-- a risk, if only a small one.\n",
