This is maybe the nicest place you can find within the Bitcoin community.\n\nSo while I might sign onto a CoC (though again, I haven't yet taken the time to read this one) I'm unsure one is really needed in this case.\n\nHaving said all this, please do not turn this PR, or any PR, into a personal fight. @jrmithdobbs's conduct here or elsewhere is not relevant in my mind to the merits of this pull request.\n",

I have seen this happen in other projects, and I do consider this risk quite serious, as well as the risk that we develop or invite a \"language police\" culture.\n\nAs I mentioned in my earlier post, I believe that the people working on libsecp256k1 already provide a welcoming and polite environment, though I'm willing to be convinced otherwise. In particular, I think the contributors here who have **not** suffered adverse mental health effects from the caustic environment in the wider Bitcoin community (aside from those who ignore it entirely) are a minority. So I trust the current maintainers to uphold the current level of conduct, if only for their own sake.\n\nSo with those thoughts I'm going to leave this PR alone for a while, and perhaps a maintainer with a more strongly-felt stance will step in.\n",
