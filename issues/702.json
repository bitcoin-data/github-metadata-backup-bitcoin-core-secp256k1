In places like Bitcoin Core the environment has a fast SIMD or SHA-NI sha256, ... it actually makes a measurable difference in signing time to use SHA-NI.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there were some -Dlibsecp2561k_sha256init=x  -Dlibsecp2561k_sha256update=y  -Dlibsecp2561k_sha256final=z  settings that could be used to compile time substitute in another library and leave the internal one out.",

Decide that the context needs to be size X, provide an opaque struct with unsigned array size X, and the implementer can memcpy this into his own Context back and forth (or type pun it? need to look into what the standard says on that).\r\n\r\n2. The implementer also needs to provide a header with the name `sha256.h` that defines the struct+functions using the same names/symbols we use.\r\n\r\n3. Provide a c_void pointer to the context in the function's API. (it then requires a reset function to reset the context, and it limits us because we can't hash two things \"in parallel\")\r\n\r\n\r\nAny feedback on which is best or maybe a different solution is appreciated.",

      "body": "> It's a bit silly that the library packs in its own sha256 even when the user has their own and on small devices it's a costly waste of space. \r\n\r\n> In places like Bitcoin Core the environment has a fast SIMD or SHA-NI sha256, ... it actually makes a measurable difference in signing time to use SHA-NI.\r\n\r\nGoing a step back, I believe that these are separate concerns. As per the discussion here, an override helps mostly to save space. \r\n\r\nIf we want to profit from hardware optimizations, this is somewhat orthogonal. An override would help here but only if the caller controls the compilation. This is true for Bitcoin Core but in general it's rather an exception. Also, if you look at Core's SHA256 implementation (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/crypto/sha256.cpp), it's not clear how the override would look like. Depending on the available hardware, the essential function is either `Transform`, `Transform_2way`, `Transform_4way`, `Transform_8way`.\r\n\r\nThis is an argument in favor of optimizing our SHA256 implementation (independent of the possibility to override), and I tend to believe that this is desirable. We didn't want to do this in the past because SHA256 was an implementation detail. But as it's an integral part of Schnorr verification and signing now, things have changed. It's just somewhat messy: We'd need to duplicate code from Core (and worse, change it to C). Or move SHA256 (and maybe other stuff such as ChaCha20 for #760) to a separate library that's linked to secp256k1 and Core. Or expose the SHA256 here and make Core use them. None of this sounds great.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

The function could also run a selftest.\n - The callback implements one \"SHA256 transform\" and gets a pointer to an array of 8  `uint32_t` and a pointer to an array of 64 bytes message data.\n\nAdditional considerations:\n - Compile-time override could also be added.\n - The callback could also take a parameter `n` that specifies the number of transforms but that's not super useful for us because n will be 1 for ECDSA signing and Schnorr verification which are the primary performance targets. \n",
