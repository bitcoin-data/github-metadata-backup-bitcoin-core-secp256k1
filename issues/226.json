      "body": "External libraries are probably not suitable. For verification we have consensus concerns, for signing we have constant time concerns... plus I would be surprised if you'd find anything useful out of them. E.g. All GMP does for us usefully now is modular inversion (and Andrew is working on replacing that) (and the modular inverse has the property that its very easy to verify at runtime).\n\nOn 64 bit processors the 64,64->128 widening multiplies are very powerful and look like they'll do better than SIMD. On 32-bit processors the story is different,  and SIMD may be a big win.\n\nBut deploying it will likely need a different factorization of the inner product that has more parallelism. Also, x86 SIMD is not that interesting because x86 is generally quite fast just on a clock-speed basis and all (? or almost all) x86 being produced today are 64-bit-- I'd rather see SIMD time put in to NEON than SSE.\n",

      "body": "I think there is a reasonable prospect that a multiplication algorithm similar to the one described in https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/852 would result in improved performance, needing SIMD for only addition (subtraction). IIRC correctly the number of word multiplies is reduced to the same as for squaring, but there are a considerable number of extra word additions required.\n\nI managed to get the algorithm to work in straight C code (for our 64bit field), but it was around 10-20% slower than our current implementation I think. If SIMD can even halve the cost of the additions, I think this approach would show a net improvement.\n\nI tried implementing the algorithm for the 32bit field also, but never completed it - it looked to be much more awkward as the magnitude-8 inputs have 30 bits used per word, meaning that various intermediate sums/carries end up overflowing, where they do not for 64bit.\n",
