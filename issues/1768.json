    "title": "ci: python -m pip install fails with error: externally-managed-environment",
    "body": "See for example on master: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/actions/runs/19143357521/job/54714339317#step:6:37 This happens only on MacOS so far, but we should see this on Linux soon, too.\n\n`lief` is needed for `symbol-check.py`. Since `lief` is a library, we can't use `pipx` and the clean way to solve this is to create a virtual environment for running the `symbol-check.py` script.\n\nI suggest using `uv`, a modern Python package manager. It has support for declaring dependencies of single-file scripts in a comment, see https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#running-a-script-without-dependencies . When you run the script, `uv` automatically creates a virtual environment and everything works out of the box. I think that's the best solution for stuff like `symbol-check.py`.\n\nWe use `uv` in secp256k1lab and are happy with it, I've also used it in a few other projects. It has a few other advantages, e.g., it can manage Python installations which is useful if we ever need a specific Python version. Or we could use it to test our Python scripts on multiple Python versions easily. [That's what we do in secp256k1lab, and we use a GitHub Action to install it.](https://github.com/secp256k1lab/secp256k1lab/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml#L15) (Note that using `uv` on CI does not force anyone to do the same. If you don't want to use `uv`, you can still install `lief` manually and run the script.)",
