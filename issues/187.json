The practise of asserting on statically wrong use limits the space of things that can / need to be tested here, but there is still some freedom.\n\nThis should be less \"test\" and more \"mechanical verification that the interface we present to callers isn't unintentionally changed\".\n\n(As an example, libopus' test_opus_api, calls into the library about 116 million times. I'd say that libopus has an API surface area of about 50x larger that libsecp256k1)\n",

      "description": "Motivation: libsecp is already widely used today, but often in a terribly outdated version. It's likely that a release process would help with that. Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",

(Compile the library, then compile tests that link to that library from code in a separate directory)\r\n\r\nBroadly I see:\r\n* Conformance tests - Like OpenSSL to ensure that the cyrpto is correct, these are very good today\r\n* Performance tests - ensure that the operations are performant (handed by bench*.c and friends), these exist\r\n* Client tests - Build and sanity check that a consumer can accomplish it's task, needs work\r\n* (NEW) API tests - Do all the things that a client shouldn't do and make sure its gracefully handled.  Because of the nature of this it seems like the wise idea might be to use a language like python/ruby and FFI the API surface because it's easier to create a large matrix of tests this way.  It also tests that FFI works correctly (as much as I hate FFI 😆)",
