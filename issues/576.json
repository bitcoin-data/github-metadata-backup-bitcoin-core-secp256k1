But one is actually in `secp256k1.h`, that's why I was confused, and `secp256k1_context_create_sign_verify` does not exist (in this form). I think if you just want to use those, then just include `include/secp256k1.h`. The other headers are for specific modules.\r\n\r\n> > Don't except further help.\r\n> \r\n> Not quite sure what to make out of that. Did I offend you somehow?

Also I just wanted to express that I may not want to invest more time in this issue but for no particular reason other than that my time is limited.",
