    "title": "Erroneous comment and VERIFY_CHECK in ecdsa_sig_sign",
    "body": "I've been following along the ECDSA signing code and have come across what I think is an incorrect comment. In `secp256k1_ecdsa_sig_sign` the code makes the following recommendation:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/96d8ccbd16090551aa003bfa4acd108b0496cb89/src/ecdsa_impl.h#L285-L293\r\n\r\nHowever, these two conditions are not actually checked before calling. The main call doesn't:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/96d8ccbd16090551aa003bfa4acd108b0496cb89/src/secp256k1.c#L491-L510\r\n\r\nNote that `sigr` is the nonce (R)'s x coordinate reduced modulo q as a scalar. The caller is only checking properties of the secret nonce not `sigr` (it doesn't even compute the point for R). Maybe this code was meant to check the secret nonce that's passed in instead?\r\n\r\nThere doesn't seem to be any problem with `sigr` overlfowing (the verification algorithm actually accounts for this possibility by adding the curve order to `sigr` if it doesn't work the first time!). `sigr` being 0 is a problem but the probability of this happening is so low I wouldn't bother accounting for it. I think this comment and VERIFY_CHECKS can be removed.\r\n\r\nMore generally there doesn't seem to be a problem with the secret nonce overflowing either but the while loop in the caller enforces that and that it's not 0.\r\n",

      "body": "Hm, this in indeed strange. I agree, this is not an issue. Both of these conditions are computationally unreachable, so this is not a problem and not at all exploitable. But we should still fix it.\r\n\r\nThis was introduced by @apoelstra in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/commit/25e3cfbf9b52d2f5afa543f967a73aa8850d2038. As I read this commit message, I think he really had the secret nonce `k` in mind instead `r`, which is the x-coord of the public nonce. A signature with a zero `r` is invalid by the spec, so we should return 0 to make the caller retry with a different nonce. Overflow is not an issue. \r\n\r\nI think we should basically revert that commit, but then change the resulting code to fail late to be compliant with the new constant-time test (#710, #708).\r\n\r\n@apoelstra Can you comment on this?",

The reverted\r\ncommit was probably based on the assumption that this is about the touched\r\nchecks cover the secret nonce k instead of r, which is the x-coord of the public\r\nnonce. A signature with a zero r is invalid by the spec, so we should return 0\r\nto make the caller retry with a different nonce. Overflow is not an issue.\r\n\r\nThen a second commit makes the resulting code constant-time in whether r is zero,\r\nin order to pass the new constant-time test. \r\n    \r\nFixes #720.",
