    "title": "Add MuSig2 module",
    "body": "I think a module for MuSig2 would be in the scope of libsecp256k1. Its relevance for the Bitcoin ecosystem is demonstrated by several factors:\r\n- MuSig2 is already being adopted for [Bitcoin payments](https://blog.bitgo.com/save-fees-with-musig2-at-bitgo-3248d690f573).\r\n- I have been inquired by various Lightning and (hardware) wallet developers about if and when MuSig2 will be in libsecp.\r\n- Various developers of LN and (hardware) wallets have inquired about the integration of MuSig2 into libsecp and its timeline.\r\n- There are specifications that depend on MuSig2, such as the [\"simple taproot channels\" BOLT](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/995) and MuSig2 [PSBT](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-October/021988.html) and [descriptor](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-October/021989.html) BIPs.\r\n\r\nMuSig2 has a detailed [specification](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki) (with reference code and test vectors) and [security proofs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1261).\r\n\r\nI suggest to copy the MuSig2 module from [libsecp256k1-zkp](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp) which has already undergone significant review. I volunteer to do this. We should, however, remove the functions for MuSig2 adaptor signatures as they lack both a specification and a satisfactory security proof.\r\n",
