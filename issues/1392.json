    "body": "Roadmap (keeping this up to date):\r\n\r\nI think the natural way forward for us is:\r\n - [x] Move native Windows tasks to GitHub Actions (#1389 and #1397)\r\n - [x] Move SageMath task to GitHub Actions (#1399)\r\n - [x] Move native macOS tasks to GitHub Actions, this will convert them to x86_64 unfortunately (#1394, #1404)\r\n - Move Linux tasks to the Bitcoin Core persistent workers or alternatively to GitHub Actions\r\n   - [x] wine/msvc tasks (converting them to native windows in #1401)\r\n   - [x] wine/mingw tasks (#1398)\r\n   - [x] actual normal Linux tasks (#1396)\r\n   - [x] special tasks like qemu/sanitizers (#1406, #1409)\r\n\r\nPossible follow-ups:\r\n - ~Consider using [artifacts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts) to move the Docker image from the Docker build job to the actual CI job (for Linux tasks).~ (Not worth the hassle, the current approach seems to work well.)<details><summary>Details</summary>\r\n This should be a [cleaner solution](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1398#issuecomment-1677074743), but it adds some complexity. It's also worth checking if this avoids [network issues](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1396#issuecomment-1684108729). In terms of delay, [this adds about 12 min uploading time to the Docker build job, but avoids about 1 min delay in the actual CI jobs](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1396#issuecomment-1686387785) as compared to the current solution that relies purely on the GHA cache (#1398).  So this will speed up CI if we could avoid re-uploading existing artifacts, e.g., have another digest file that just stores the SHA256, and re-upload only if the SHA does not match. But all of this is probably not worth the complexity if the current approach with the cache turns out to be good enough.</details>\r\n - [x] Enable Valgrind on macOS again now that the macOS tasks run on x86_64 (#1151, #1412)\r\n - Bring back some ARM testing (see for details: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1394#issuecomment-1682321329)\r\n   - [x] Add a task for ctimetest on ARM64/Linux/Valgrind on Cirrus CI using free minutes or the self-hosted runner  (#1426)\r\n   - [x] Add more ARM64 tests on QEMU (#1414)\r\n   - [ ] Add ARM32 tests (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1426#issuecomment-1728543515) \r\n - [x] Consider moving the `git` safe directory stuff to `run-in-docker-action` (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1411)\r\n - [ ] After the migration, check if the build matrix still makes sense \r\n - [ ] cosmetics: Job names could need a rework\r\n - [ ] cosmetics: Printing of log files could be improved\r\n\r\n\r\nOther related PRs:\r\n - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1403\r\n - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1410\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCorresponding Bitcoin Core issue: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28098\r\n\r\nCirrus CI will cap the community cluster, see [cirrus-ci.org/blog/2023/07/17/limiting-free-usage-of-cirrus-ci](https://cirrus-ci.org/blog/2023/07/17/limiting-free-usage-of-cirrus-ci/). As with Core, the pricing model makes it totally unreasonable to pay for compute credits (multiple thousand USD / month).\r\n\r\nThe plan in Bitcoin Core is to move native Windows+macOS tasks to GitHub Actions, and move Linux tasks to persistent workers (=self-hosted). If I read the Bitcoin Core IRC [meeting notes](https://bitcoin.jonasschnelli.ch/ircmeetings/logs/bitcoin-core-dev/2023/bitcoin-core-dev.2023-08-03-14.00.log.html#l-79) correctly, @MarcoFalke [said](https://bitcoin.jonasschnelli.ch/ircmeetings/logs/bitcoin-core-dev/2023/bitcoin-core-dev.2023-08-03-14.00.log.html#l-99) these workers will also be available for libsecp256k1.\r\n\r\nBut the devil is in the details: \r\n\r\nFor macOS, we need to take also #1153 into account. It seems that [GitHub-hosted macOS runners are on x86_64](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources). The good news is that Valgrind should work again then, but the (very) bad is that this will reduce our number of native ARM tasks to zero. We still have some QEMU tasks, but we can't even the run the Valgrind cttimetests on them (maybe this would now work with MSan?!) @MarcoFalke Are the self-hosted runners only x86_64? \r\n\r\nFor Linux tasks, the meeting notes say that the main reason for using persistent workers is that some tasks require a very specific environment (e.g., the [USDT ASan job](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28161)). I don't think we have such requirements, so I tend to think that moving everything to GitHub Actions is a bit cleaner for us. With a persistent worker, Cirrus CI anyway acts only as a \"coordination layer\" between the worker and GitHub. Yet another way is to the self-hosted runners with GitHub Actions, see my comment https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28098#issuecomment-1665661274). ",

Then we could move macOS back to ARM. Until that happens, perhaps we can add a QEMU jobs that run the ctimetests on MSan (clang-only) at least.

Now that I think about it, that's somewhat expected (e.g., where should the built images be pushed?). \r\n\r\nAlternatives:\r\n - Set up our own Docker pipeline on Cirrus (but that seems overkill) \r\n - Use the free minutes (but they're [shared among all repos of bitcoin-core](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1414#issuecomment-1703864886))\r\n - Go back to the QEMU approach and try to [compile compiler-rt on our own](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1414#issuecomment-1701339719) (but that's a rabbit hole and doesn't cover gcc)\r\n - Don't use a Dockerfile (but that means we won't get gcc-snapshot, unless we build it every time or cache it somehow)\r\n - Do nothing (and wait for [native ARM64 on GHA](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/528))\r\n\r\nI think we should do one of the last two?

Pull requests to bitcoin-core/gui should already run it on the same machines, but that seems fragile to rely on.\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/blob/9d3b216e009a53ffcecd57e7f10df15cccd5fd6d/ci/test/04_install.sh#L30\r\n\r\n> I assume the first step performs the caching automatically, rebuildung layers only as necessary? Sorry, I'm not familiar with podman, I have only used Docker so far.\r\n\r\nYes, it is the same. You should be able to use `docker` as well, if you want, which is `podman-docker`.\r\n\r\n> Right, yeah, I'm just not sure if I want to spend time on this.\r\n\r\nIf you mean reaching out to a sponsor, I am happy to reach out, if there is a cost estimate.",

(Or @hebasto, if you want to give it a try, feel free to go ahead, of course. My plan was to simply \"abuse\" the existing Dockerfile to avoid maintaining a second one, at the cost of a somewhat larger image. The existing file should build fine except that debian won't let you install an arm64 cross-compiler on arm64. So we'd need to add some check to skip these packages when we're on arm64, see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1163/files#diff-751ef1d9fd31c5787e12221f590262dcf7d96cfb166d456e06bd0ccab115b60d .)\r\n\r\n> If you mean reaching out to a sponsor, I am happy to reach out, if there is a cost estimate.\r\n\r\nOkay, thanks, but let's first try docker/podman then.\r\n",

That means we should stick to the Cirrus runners for ARM. ",
