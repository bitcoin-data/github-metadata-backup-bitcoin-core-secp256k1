I think you mean \"a signature where a group of people are involved rather than just one\", but there are different schemes with different names, security models and designs, depending how many participants are needed in what roles,\r\n\r\nThen regarding your question about proving membership in a MuSig aggregate key, yes, the only way to do this is to reveal the full set of keys (which will then prove membership of all members, and non-membership of anybody else). If you want to do this privately or compactly you could do it inside of a zero-knowledge proof, but producing such a proof will still require knowledge of the complete key set.",
