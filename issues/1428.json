    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've tried to compile it with those options above (gcc12), to see the performance difference, but it looks like\r\n96G ram is not enough. Probably just with a few less, or only one core I can make it, but I would have\r\ntwo questions:\r\n\r\n-       Is there any speed-up, or performace benefit on [secp256k1_ec_pubkey_tweak_add] function using with that large table\r\n        against the basic size (15, I guess..) setting? This would be the only important function.\r\n\r\n-       If someone already compiled it with success.. How much memory is enough? Maybe clang less hungry.. I don't know.\r\n        The 24/8 seems to be the \"fastest\" settings (according to the config), but anyway.. can I go bigger? :)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n",
