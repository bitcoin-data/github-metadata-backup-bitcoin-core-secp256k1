    "title": "Add internal helper for serializing a non-infinity group element to a compressed public key",
    "body": "In more recent modules (ellswift, musig and silentpayments), the following pattern of serializing a non-infinity group element to a 33-bytes compressed public key appears repeatedly:\n```\n    size_t ser_size = 33;\n    int ser_ret;\n    .....\n    ser_ret = secp256k1_eckey_pubkey_serialize(ge, out33, &ser_size, 1);\n#ifdef VERIFY\n    VERIFY_CHECK(ser_ret && ser_size == 33);\n#else\n    (void)ser_ret;\n#endif\n```\nOne could deduplicate these instances by a new function, as suggested by @w0xlt in the latest silentpayments module PR, see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1765#pullrequestreview-3462461331. This could simplify the code in the modules quite a bit (less LOC, less variables, less pre-processor blocks). Demo branch: https://github.com/theStack/secp256k1/commit/e02365188ac8bb5129dc36c817fb465dfa5f7b76. It seems a reasonable idea to me, but not sure about the right naming of the function and where to put it. Also, one drawback might be that if the VERIFY_CHECK fails, it's a bit harder to find out the cause if it fails in a helper rather than directly in the module code (not sure if we care about that?). Opening this as an issue first to see if there is conceptual support.",
