    "title": "Name public API structs so they can be forward declared",
    "body": "Currently all of the structs in the public API are only typedef'd, rather than both named and typedef'd. As such, the structs cannot be forward declared and instead using the struct name (typedef) in a header requires including the library headers. This can be problematic for projects which want to reduce the inclusion tree as much as possible.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nFor some context behind this request, in my [MuSig2 PR to Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29675), since the `secp256k1_musig_secnonce` cannot be copied or serialized, I have to pass around a pointer to the object in various functions, so many headers need to include `secp256k1_musig.h` just for the struct's declaration. Including `secp256k1_musig.h` in those headers result in needing to directly link libsecp256k1 in several of build targets that did not previously require it. This issue seems like it can be avoided by forward declaring that (and other) struct, but in order to do so, it needs to be named in the libsecp headers.\r\n\r\nMy current workaround is to pass `void *` and then cast them as necessary but I don't really like doing that.",
