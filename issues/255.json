    "title": "Bindings for PHP",
    "body": "I've been working on an extension for PHP which wraps libsecp256k1, and think it's just about complete. I noticed the PR's for java bindings, and I wondered if it might be worth moving the code here? \n\nI'm not sure if anyone else is developing these, but mainly asking since I'm experimenting with packaging the extension as .deb package, but I need to ensure that libsecp256k1 is installed on the system as well.\n\nI know it's quite early for a secp256k1-dev package in apt, but since I'm now considering gitian builds to produce a .deb for this extension, the same could be done for the library itself. If we keep the sources here we can build each binding/release in the one gitian build. \n\nThe bindings are here: https://github.com/Bit-Wasp/secp256k1-php, and there are tests for pretty much everything besides the privkey_import/export functions(). Yet to include the edge cases (r/s = 0, etc), but it's standing up pretty well. It is my first foray into C in a while, so I'd appreciate all the feedback I can get!\n\nAnyway, interested to hear what people think, I can follow up with a PR if people are happy enough!\n",

      "body": "Hello, I wrote some [Ruby bindings for the secp256k1](https://github.com/DavidEGrayson/secp256k1-rb).  In case it's useful to you, the main features I wanted to achieve for that project were:\n- Provides access to all features of the secp256k1 library.\n- Does not add any new features.\n- Avoids making arbitrary decisions when possible.\n- Provides a safe interface: there should be no way for a user of the wrapper to cause undefined behavior or memory leaks.  (One exception is when multiple threads are used in an unsafe way.)\n- Exception messages produced by this wrapper are less verbose than they could be to help avoid leaking secret information.\n\nI noticed your PHP binding is creating some kind of global context instead of letting the user create their own.  That only seems like a good idea to me if that global context can somehow be saved so it doesn't have to be recreated for every HTTP request that uses it.  Is that the case?\n\nI don't see any code of yours for checking the lengths of input strings and things like that.  I suspect that, like Ruby users, PHP users are accustomed to using libraries that don't produce segmentation faults when invalid input is passed in, so I would recommend validating the user's inputs to prevent things like that.\n",

      "body": "Very cool.  I'm happy to see that your bindings have tests. Please be clear in your readme that secp256k1 is unreleased and experimental right now; it shouldn't generally be used or depended on.\n\nWith respect to input validation the principle to assure is that the behavior is as unconditionally safe as possible.  I've seen things like JS crypto libraries where if the object passed in was an array rather than a string they'd silently sign zero or something like that.   Ideally it should be hard to use incorrectly, but if its used incorrectly it should fail in the safest way possible. \n",

      "body": "@faizkhan00 - yeah, I can appreciate that. I had been thinking of roughly the same - package a versioned release `secp256k1-dev-something` after each break, and let people fall behind in releases if they dare (exposing people to updates every week or two might get old fast, but know personally I'd end up compiling against the latest for myself). \n\n@DavidEGrayson Thanks, good advise to stick to. I'll have a look at your code today. \n\nInput validation, I can do today. I'll have a look at copying contexts somehow, though not sure how I'd approach that. To get them into userland I'm thinking I'll have to wrap them in a resource. I'll have a look over libsecp256k1 to see if I can dump that memory or something, and initialize contexts from this. Might come back to you for more details here!\n\nI guess I should detail any other places where the bindings deviate from libsecp256k1:\n- A global sign and verify context is created.\n- Userland functions don't include the context param, the extension takes care of that. \n- In fact, none of the context_\\* functions have been exposed yet. I ought to get working on that. \n- I haven't exposed `secp256k1_nonce_function_t` whatsoever - the bindings don't offer that argument to userland, and passes null forcing deterministic signatures. \n\n@gmaxwell - OK, will do! Thanks for that warning, I'll start thinking defensively. \n\nhttps://github.com/Bit-Wasp/bitcoin-php/tree/master/src/Crypto/EcAdapter\n\nI ultimately started writing this so I'd have an alternative to pure PHP ECDSA in something else. In that library, the interface has typehinted args, takes care of serializing (why I haven't had problems passing few characters yet) and throws exceptions if the secp256k1_\\* returns any of the documented error codes, so it's usage is quite safe there. (See Secp256k1.php in the link above)\n\nBut I suppose I have ignored some things for the sake of getting it to work. I'll spend some time on the points today and see what I can turn up! \n",

Since it's a type error, I've went with throwing an exception, since it can be caught by the user and tested for (as opposed to a fatal error which can't be tested, or a notice that returns null) \n\nI noticed that passing differently sized key/hash strings (eg, \\x41, and then with padding on the left or right), produces different results, so going to enforce a 32byte size on data passed for most of these cases.\n",

The hard work only really needs to be done once.",
