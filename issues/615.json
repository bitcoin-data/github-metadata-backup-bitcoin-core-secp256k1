Why these magic code could work?\r\nThanks\r\n",

      "body": "For me, I often find that reading code and taking the time to work through it an expirement is the best way to understand something. a paper has to be _really good_ for it to clearly express complex ideas to someone who isn't already deeply seeped in the subject, and many papers aren't.  Though I pinged other contributors to see if they have suggestions.\r\n\r\nProbably the most important non-trivial aspect of our code is the use of an over-complete representation for carry reduction.  Imagine writing out \"long multiplication\" by hand like you were (probably) taught in school.  You spend a significant amount of time propagating carries between digits. The same is true for the computer (often more so, because conditional behaviour creates dependencies that blocks the CPUs internal parallelism).  But imagine that the digits in your base-10 multiply were allowed to go larger than 9? -- just temporarily-- Then you could defer some carrying operations and perform them in batches.  The limit on this is that your individual operations need to be able to handle the larger digits, so there is a trade-off between the total number of internal multiplies and the total number of carries.\r\n\r\nI guess the other important concept is that multiplication (or squaring) is itself an operation which is suitable for algebraic optimization. Although we don't use karatsuba there are many good writeups about how it works online ( such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm ) which might help give you a feel for non-trivial multiplication algorithms and help you think of multiplication more as an algorithm and less of a black box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
