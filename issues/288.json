    "body": "Function `secp256k1_ecdsa_sign` takes a pointer to `secp256k1_ecdsa_signature_t` that is considered opaque. Unfortunately, in my [Ruby FFI extension](https://github.com/oleganza/btcruby/blob/4399344b4b417f24f811fbd74e2631230550ba70/lib/btcruby/secp256k1.rb#L17-L23) I have to copy the declaration to allocate the struct with proper size. It would be nice if there were factory methods `secp256k1_ecdsa_signature_create/destroy` to allocate the struct and get the pointer to it (and destroy accordingly). Similar methods for `secp256k1_pubkey_t` as well. WDYT?\n",
