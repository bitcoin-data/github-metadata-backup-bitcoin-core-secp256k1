    "body": "04:22 < gmaxwell> Which I think also suggests another test we can add. Our group law should also hold for all B even when B results in a curve that has low order points.\n04:23 < gmaxwell> We can exhaustively test low order subgroups.\n04:23 < gmaxwell> e.g. this is something tests.c could do.\n04:28 < gmaxwell> this has the benefit of allowing an 'exhaustive' test of the group law without changing the field.\n\nE.g.  on y^2 = x^3 + 4  there is a subgroup with a generator of order 199, and we can 'exhaustively' verify the group law on this subgroup by generating all the points and trying all pairs of adds and multiplies. (Though this doesn't cover all possible projective points).\n",

      "description": "Motivation: libsecp is already widely used today, but often in a terribly outdated version. It's likely that a release process would help with that. Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",

          "body": "We observe that when changing the b-value in the elliptic curve formula\n`y^2 = x^3 + ax + b`, the group law is unchanged. Therefore our functions\nfor secp256k1 will be correct if and only if they are correct when applied\nto the curve defined by `y^2 = x^3 + 4` defined over the same field. This\ncurve has a point P of order 199.\n\nThis commit adds a test which computes the subgroup generated by P and\nexhaustively checks that addition of every pair of points gives the correct\nresult.\n\nUnfortunately we cannot test scalar multiplication, const-time or otherwise,\nby the same mechanism. The reason is that our ecmult functions both compute\na wNAF representation of the scalar, and this representation is tied to the\norder of the group.\n\nTesting with the incomplete version of gej_add_ge (found in 5de4c5dff^)\nshows that this detects the incompleteness when adding P - 106P, which\nis exactly what we expected since 106 is a cube root of 1 mod 199.\n\nExhaustive tests added for the following internal functions:\n- `secp256k1_ge_is_infinity`, `secp256k1_gej_is_infinity`\n- `secp256k1_gej_add_var`, `secp256k1_gej_add_ge`, `secp256k1_gej_add_ge_var`, `secp256k1_gej_add_zinv_var`\n- `secp256k1_gej_double_nonzero`, `secp256k1_gej_double_var`\n- `secp256k1_ge_neg`, `secp256k1_gej_neg`\n- `secp256k1_ecmult`, `secp256k1_ecmult_const`\n\nAnd also (unfortunately with a bit of surgery; the original functions don't work with small group orders)\n- `secp256k1_ecdsa_sign`\n- `secp256k1_ecdsa_verify`\n",
