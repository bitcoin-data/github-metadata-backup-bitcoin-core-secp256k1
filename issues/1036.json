    "body": "The tests (src/tests.cpp and included modules) consist of some tests whose runtime is independent of the TEST_ITERS variable, and some which are. The ones that are independent take a significant amount of time (compared to the other ones, at a normal TEST_ITERS level). The ones that do depend on it do so in a rather inconsistent way.\r\n\r\nSo to improve upon that:\r\n* Turn constant-time tests into TEST_ITERS-proportional ones were possible.\r\n* Perhaps disable some very slow constant-time ones entirely at very low TEST_ITERS levels.\r\n* Run benchmarks on each of the proportional ones, and adjust to make sure they all get a somewhat representative amount of runtime in typical configurations.",
