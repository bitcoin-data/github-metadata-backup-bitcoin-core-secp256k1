    "title": "docs: \"pointer to context object\" vs \"context object\"",
    "body": "We should always say \"**pointer to** a secp256k1 context object\" in the API docs\r\n\r\nFrom IRC discussion, see https://gnusha.org/secp256k1/2024-01-04.log :\r\n```\r\n08:37 < nickler> \"ctx: pointer to a context object.\" or \"ctx: a secp256k1 context object.\". We currently use both arbitrarily afaics.\r\n08:42 < real_or_random> nickler: I think this confusion stems from _context_create where the docs say \"Returns: a newly created context object.\"\r\n08:44 < real_or_random> I guess the initial idea was that the pointers of type secp256k1_context* ARE \"context objects\" (and don't POINT TO context object). perhaps this is also the reason for the different spacing around the asterisk for pointers \r\n08:44 < real_or_random> I mean for contexts \r\n08:46 < real_or_random> but I think that's too much abstraction. we should just always say \"pointer to a context object\" \r\n08:46 < sipa> I can't remember ever thinking that the pointer itself was to be treated as the context object.\r\n08:47 < sipa> I think there are other places in the code where we confuse (for brevity) objects and pointers to them, though perhaps not in the public headers.\r\n08:47 < real_or_random> ok, maybe this is just my wrong interpretation\r\n````",
