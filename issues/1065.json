    "body": "More things to improve after #988:\r\n\r\n- [x] Compile precomputation as a separate object file and link it (solved by #1042)\r\n- [x] Speed up `secp256k1_ecmult_gen_context_build` at context creation. It currently computes fixed values which could be made static (open PR: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1120)\r\n- [ ] Document (or set by default) build options to remove unused static tables (and code) when no signing/verification function is called (something like `--disable-shared CFLAGS=\"-fdata-sections -ffunction-sections -O2 -g\" LDFLAGS=\"-Wl,--gc-sections\"`)\r\n- [x] Document the backwards-compatible API changes made in #988 and in #956: All contexts except the `no_precomp` context are now effectively signing contexts. The `no_precomp` context is effectively a verification context., and name is misleading as no context uses dynamic precompuation now. The reason why `no_precomp` is different is that it's impossible to re-randomize it.\r\n- [x] Decide what to do with the `no_precomp` context: Possibilities include: renaming it, deprecating it (its main user rust-secp256k1 won't like this), and/or promote it a full signing context, maybe with a verbose name such as \"global-context-less-secure\" in the spirit of what rust-secp256k1 is doing.   \r\n   ",

      "description": "Motivation: libsecp is already widely used today, but often in a terribly outdated version. It's likely that a release process would help with that. Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",

          "body": "Consolidating discussion from #385 #386 #387. Tobin is proposing to re-randomize contexts, not just the global one, when they are created -- though naturally only if the `rand` feature is enabled. Our current situation is kinda weird -- for users of global contexts, we require they \"opt out\" of rerandomization by choosing the `global-context-less-secure` feature vs the `global-context` flag, while ordinary users must \"opt in\" by creating a context then explicitly calling `randomize()` on it.\r\n\r\nA bit of context (hah):\r\n* re-randomization is not free: it takes about as long as a signing operation (around 50us on a desktop computer)\r\n* on the other hand, context generation is extremely expensive (multiple milliseconds on a desktop computer) so this is fine during context creation; but on the third hand, now that we are moving toward pre-computing all the tables, context creation will be nearly free, so the re-randomization would then be the bulk of the \"create context\" operation\r\n* re-randomization of verification contexts is a no-op. This discussion is only about signing contexts\r\n\r\nHere is my proposal:\r\n1. We remove the `global-context-less-secure` feature; `global-context` enables the global context, and we rerandomize it on first use if `rand` is also enabled.\r\n2. Similarly we randomize **all** signing contexts on creation, if `rand` is enabled\r\n3. We also change `sign()` and `sign_schnorr` to rerandomize the context after each signing operation. We add a `sign_no_rerandomize` method to opt out of this\r\n   1. This would nearly double signing time, **although** sipa points out that there is a theoretical way, with help from upstream, we could make the rerandomization 99%+ faster, by essentially only doing one bit of re-randomization per signature\r\n   2. This would also force the signing API to take a `&mut` pointer to the context object, which really sucks.\r\n3. We leave the `rerandomize()` methods in place but document that users have basically no reason to call them manually.\r\n\r\nAlternate proposals:\r\n* Leave the `sign` methods alone but add `sign_randomize` ones which also do the re-randomization\r\n* Embed a mutex in our `Context` objects so that re-randomization can be done with normal non-mutable references. (May be OK with \"fast re-randomization\", almost certainly not with full re-randomization, which would basically cause parallel signing operations to be force-serialized.)\r\n\r\ncc @TheBlueMatt @tcharding\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/881 (which is not the \"one-bit rerandomization\" idea, but is similar and has a similar effect).\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1058 which will affect upstream's blinding logic.",

      "body": ">     * [ ]  Decide what to do with the `no_precomp` context: Possibilities include: renaming it, deprecating it (its main user rust-secp256k1 won't like this), and/or promote it a full signing context, maybe with a verbose name such as \"global-context-less-secure\" in the spirit of what rust-secp256k1 is doing.\r\n\r\nI suggest we \r\n * rename `_no_precomp` to `_builtin` (or similar)\r\n * keep a deprecated alias `_no_precomp` \r\n * expose the self-tests in the public API\r\n \r\nWe should get rid of the \"signing\"/\"verification\" terminology. But there's potential for bikeshedding.  We could also just call it `secp256k1_context_builtin`, or `secp256k1_context_static`, or `secp256k1_context_basic` which is generic enough that we'll never have to rename it again, even if we add cpuid/whatever in the future (see #780). A more verbose version will be `_no_secret_ops`. But ECDH is a secret op but we don't have blinding... And I don't mind that people are forced to at least have a glimpse at the docs. \r\n\r\nDoes this sound good?\r\n\r\nAs a next step, if desired, we could introduce a variant `builtin_secret_ops_less_secure` (or similar) which is a \"signing\" context that cannot be randomized... Not sure if we want this.",
