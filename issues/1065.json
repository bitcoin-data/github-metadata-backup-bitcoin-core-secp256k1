    "body": "More things to improve after #988:\r\n\r\n- [x] Compile precomputation as a separate object file and link it (solved by #1042)\r\n- [x] Speed up `secp256k1_ecmult_gen_context_build` at context creation. It currently computes fixed values which could be made static (open PR: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1120)\r\n- [ ] Document (or set by default) build options to remove unused static tables (and code) when no signing/verification function is called (something like `--disable-shared CFLAGS=\"-fdata-sections -ffunction-sections -O2 -g\" LDFLAGS=\"-Wl,--gc-sections\"`)\r\n- [x] Document the backwards-compatible API changes made in #988 and in #956: All contexts except the `no_precomp` context are now effectively signing contexts. The `no_precomp` context is effectively a verification context., and name is misleading as no context uses dynamic precompuation now. The reason why `no_precomp` is different is that it's impossible to re-randomize it.\r\n- [x] Decide what to do with the `no_precomp` context: Possibilities include: renaming it, deprecating it (its main user rust-secp256k1 won't like this), and/or promote it a full signing context, maybe with a verbose name such as \"global-context-less-secure\" in the spirit of what rust-secp256k1 is doing.   \r\n   ",

      "description": "Motivation: libsecp is already widely used today, but often in a terribly outdated version. It's likely that a release process would help with that. Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",

But there's potential for bikeshedding.  We could also just call it `secp256k1_context_builtin`, or `secp256k1_context_static`, or `secp256k1_context_basic` which is generic enough that we'll never have to rename it again, even if we add cpuid/whatever in the future (see #780). A more verbose version will be `_no_secret_ops`. But ECDH is a secret op but we don't have blinding... And I don't mind that people are forced to at least have a glimpse at the docs. \r\n\r\nDoes this sound good?\r\n\r\nAs a next step, if desired, we could introduce a variant `builtin_secret_ops_less_secure` (or similar) which is a \"signing\" context that cannot be randomized... Not sure if we want this.",
