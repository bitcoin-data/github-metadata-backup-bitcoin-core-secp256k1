    "title": "Support custom hash functions in ECDH API",
    "body": "Current ECDH implementation always hashes both `Px` and `Py` of point multiplication result with SHA256. It makes impossible to use `secp256k1` with existing protocols like [Bitmessage](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Encryption) which uses `SHA512(Px)` as shared secret. As mentioned [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1/pull/252#issuecomment-154052769), possible solution for this is to accept custom hash function in API similar to custom nonce function.\n\ncc @apoelstra\n",

      "body": "It seems to me that a major reason for handling the hash internally was to avoid \"revealing\" the raw point coordinate(s). Supporting a (callback-based) custom hash function lets them \"escape\" again (even if the callback is isolated somehow, it could still calculate a no-op of the input).\n\nSo it seems to me that internal hashing with a customisable hash function is a needless complication. Of course, if you're restricted to SHA256, you can't use this even for what should be an obvious target - TLS key exchange.\n\nI propose we abandon the internal hashing approach altogether.\n",

      "body": "@peterdettman We are not trying to avoid revealing anything, but rather not provide interfaces that by that we know will primarily be used in less safe ways because using it that way is the simplest thing possible. \n\n[Because of things like http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2014-March/004720.html (see also later posts where I gave some more attacks) I wish we didn't have a reason to expose ECDH at all, in favor of safe higher level constructs-- e.g. ECIES instead of \"here is ecdh then you can makeup your own crypto scheme\", because we should assume that the caller is not a subject matter expert in cryptography whos work is being reviewed by other subject matter experts-- but thats not always the best trade-off.. and sometimes we have to expose more to get functionality.  But the interface can still encourage more prudent behavior.]\n\nAn example of this is how we handle DSA nonces.  By default the library uses RFC6979 internally. But if you need to do something special, you can send in a callback that implements whatever you need-- upto and including \"emits a constant nonce\". :)   So the caller can do whatever they like, but if they do something dangerous or inadvisable at least it wasn't because it was the easiest thing to do (or worse, the only obvious thing to do). \n\nfor this PR, I think it's a good approach; we'll probably want to change the api;  I've just been too slammed this week to give it a proper review yet. :)\n",

There are several different key exchange methods each producing a premaster secret after their own fashion, then a distinct master secret generation via the TLS PRF. I would expect most implementations to have a module boundary between those two things - even if an implementation only supports ECDH(E), but uses other libraries for other curves.\n\nSwitching to constructive suggestions mode:\n- Change terminology from \"hash function\" to \"KDF\"\n- Make provision for \"shared info\" input to the KDF via the callback - and if present, use it in the default implementation.\n- I would still like to see an x-only option, since that is a common case (e.g. TLS) with potentially better performance.\n",

Though `secp256k1_ecdh` could check and reject if the input equals the output, that wouldn't stop the case when a slightly modified, but still unsafe data is returned.\n\nAnother option, **c)** was so far not mentioned: to include the _hashing_ for the common schemes (the four stated above). This has the drawback that it will take effort and time to implement all the new schemes which are deemed useful, increases code size and possibly has bigger maintenance burden. The positive aspect is that raw keys are not _leaked_. I am not convinced this single positive aspect justifies this option.\n\n@sipa did you had a chance to look at the options and perhaps @fanatid's PR #354?\n",

This would be really nice to have considering that it is roughly 2-4x faster than openssl (the double sha is especially fast since it doesn't require extra instantiation of js objects, unlike node's crypto module). I think it's reasonable to not expose an updateable object since the constant crossover between js->c++ adds overhead, and I can't think of _that_ much in bitcoin that would require or benefit from it. Having it as a single function is just simple and fast.\n\nAlso updated the git submodule to point at the bitcoin-core org.\n",

            "description": "Motivation: libsecp is already widely used today, but often in a terribly outdated version. It's likely that a release process would help with that. Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",
