    "body": "After the most recent rebuild of our cirrus docker image (no idea what triggered the rebuild but it's just a cached which can be cleared at any time), we know have clang 11 (previously clang 7), valgrind 3.16 (previously 3.14) and also new gcc version. \r\n\r\nThis causes some CI builds to fail, see for example https://cirrus-ci.com/build/5697283367895040:\r\n  - [ ] sanitizers with gcc\r\n  - [ ] valgrind with clang \r\n\r\nI'll have a look.",
