    "title": "build: Meta-issue for follow-ups to initial CMake merge (#1113)",
    "body": "Issues that have been (re)discovered in #1113 but have not been addressed there: \r\n\r\nAffecting both build systems:\r\n - [ ] Unified docs for configuration autotools/CMake/manual builds (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#issuecomment-1171307979 and  https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1142); WIP -- https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1372\r\n - [x] Improve MSVC warning options (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#discussion_r1124276576); solved by https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1328\r\n - [x] Consider changing `DLL_EXPORT` TO `SECP256k1_DLL_EXPORT` (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#discussion_r1126797102); solved by https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1367\r\n - ~Consider setting CMake's default of /MD for MSVC also in autotools builds. Perhaps make `CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY` a CMake cache variable. (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#issuecomment-1458005771)~ See https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1235#issuecomment-1609373112 and https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1235#issuecomment-1609503130\r\n - [x] Print out a warning in the tests if both `VERIFY` and `COVERAGE` are defined. For clarity, this should be done in the C source, not in the build system. (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#discussion_r1127856040); solved by https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1333\r\n - [x] Actually check if ARM assembly is supported (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#issuecomment-1460298292 and also tracked in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1034); solved by https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1304 \r\n - ~Set `-fvisibility-inlines-hidden`? (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#discussion_r1124273356).~ See https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1235#issuecomment-1466477275.\r\n -  ~Consider dropping support for Valgrind on MacOS (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#discussion_r1128588031).~ See https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1235#issuecomment-1506878980.\r\n\r\nAffecting only CMake:\r\n - [x] Changelog entry (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#issuecomment-1460298292; solved by #1225)\r\n - [x] Add CMake instructions to release process (solved by #1226)\r\n - [ ] Compute string `secp256k1` (e.g., in `target_link_libraries`) as substring of `PROJECT_NAME`. That will help with distinguishing forks. (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1229#discussion_r1130064718).\r\n - [ ] Consider recommending CMake-native build commands in the README (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#discussion_r1124301931)\r\n - [x] Use `GENERATOR_IS_MULTI_CONFIG` in the future, which requires CMake 3.9. (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#discussion_r1124460512; solved by #1239)\r\n - [x] See if we can use CMake templates to have something similar to `--enable-dev-mode`. (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#discussion_r912386477; solved by #1234)\r\n - [x] Consider dropping support for building static and shared libraries at the same time (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#discussion_r1128702492)  or alternatively, enable position-independent code globally (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#discussion_r1124264718; solved by #1230)\r\n - [x] `configure_package_config_file(... COMPATIBILITY` is `SameMajorVersion` but should probably be `SameMinorVersion` before 1.0.0 according to [our SemVer interpretation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1223#issuecomment-1460481114). But the latter requires CMake 3.11. (https://gnusha.org/secp256k1/2023-03-08.log; solved by #1239)\r\n - [ ] `make check` should run tests in parallel, like `ctest -j` (https://gnusha.org/secp256k1/2023-03-08.log); WIP -- https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1294\r\n - ~Consider using `COMPILE_FLAGS` or `COMPILE_OPTIONS` to add CFLAGS. `COMPILE_OPTIONS` requires CMake 3.11, while we currently target CMake 3.1 (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#discussion_r1125545613)~ See https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1235#issuecomment-1479363026\r\n - ~Consider [CMAKE_COMPILE_WARNING_AS_ERROR](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_COMPILE_WARNING_AS_ERROR.html) for CMake 3.24+ (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1241#issuecomment-1509008580)~ See https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1235#issuecomment-1609567532\r\n - [x] Make `SECP256K1_INSTALL` default to `PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL` on CMake 3.21+ (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1263); solved by #1284\r\n",

Needless to say, such an implementation increases the complexity of the code.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs @real-or-random rightly [noted](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#discussion_r1127856040), the current code works only for single-config generators.\r\n\r\nSuggesting to re-introduce a trivial `option(SECP256K1_COVERAGE OFF)` which enforces the only available build configuration \"Coverage\".",

      "body": "> - [ ] Consider using `COMPILE_FLAGS` or `COMPILE_OPTIONS` to add CFLAGS. `COMPILE_OPTIONS` requires CMake 3.11, while we currently target CMake 3.1 (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#discussion_r1125545613) \r\n\r\n> ... I figured out that we could set `COMPILE_FLAGS` instead, which supports generator expressions. https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_sf/COMPILE_FLAGS.html But if you ask me, that belongs exactly to the category of \"making things more CMake-ish\", which should not hold up this PR.\r\n\r\nRevisiting this issue as we [now](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1238) have the minimum required CMake 3.13.\r\n\r\nDifferent cases, when we set compiler flags, are as follows:\r\n1. Specific to a _build configuration_. We use dedicated [`CMAKE_C_FLAGS_<CONFIG>`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_FLAGS_CONFIG.html) variables for them.\r\n2. Global flags to request or suppress _warnings_ and errors. We use the [`COMPILE_OPTIONS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_dir/COMPILE_OPTIONS.html) top-directory property to handles them which is a well known CMake practice for such cases. Please note that #1240 suggests to use [`add_compile_options()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_compile_options.html) command instead of direct manipulation of the `COMPILE_OPTIONS` property.\r\n3. For _target_-specific flags we use the [`target_compile_options()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_compile_options.html) which is the best CMake practice.\r\n\r\nI cannot see what we can do about the original issue, so removing it from the task list. Let me know if I should revert it back.",

My draft attempt uses the [`EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_COVERAGE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_CONFIG.html) target property and [generator expressions](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/commit/2cdaf43d966f8407f0fb75ceb131fdca16617915) in the `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` target property which, in turn, requires CMake 3.19+. Needless to say, such an implementation increases the complexity of the code.\r\n> \r\n> As @real-or-random rightly [noted](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113#discussion_r1127856040), the current code works only for single-config generators.\r\n> \r\n> Suggesting to re-introduce a trivial `option(SECP256K1_COVERAGE OFF)` which enforces the only available build configuration \"Coverage\".\r\n\r\nWhat about using a CMake preset for Coverage builds, which just sets the right values? I think this could be a bit nicer than an option `SECP256K1_COVERAGE` but we'd need to try.",

      "body": "@sipsorcery Thanks for commenting. \r\n\r\nPerhaps there's a slight misunderstanding here. I think there are two separate issues: \r\n 1. How should the bitcoind build libsecp256k1?\r\n 2. What is the default for libsecp256k1?\r\n\r\nThe latter is our question. libsecp256k1 has many other in the ecosystem users beside bitcoind. (In fact, that's the reason why it is a separate library.) And we would like to set a reasonable default for them. \r\n\r\n> In my experience /MD (dynamically linked) is the default but then so are dynamically linked exe's. \r\n\r\nThis makes me think that we should make /MD the default. Just because that's most common on Windows.\r\n\r\n> I suspect someone decided to make bitcoind statically linked to avoid dll hell and/or a dependency introducing a vulnerability. Either way it is currently statically linked and again it would be a BIG change to make it not so.\r\n>If bitcoind on Windows is going to stay statically linked then I think it would end up being a lot of fighting to change any of the artifacts to /MD.\r\n\r\nYes, I see that this will be a mess. But when building libsecp256k1 for bitcoind, we can override anything we want and simply set /MT or /MTd. ",
