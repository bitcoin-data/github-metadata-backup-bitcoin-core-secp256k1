    "body": "When thinking about #705 I realized it's maybe a good idea to take a step back and look at this in the context of a general CI revamp. There are multiple things that would be nice and I think some of these probably have a higher priority than coverage reports:\r\n\r\n - ARM tests https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/598\r\n - Big-endian tests https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/696\r\n - Windows and/or MSVC builds? (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/451#issuecomment-746752833)\r\n - MacOS builds? (MacOS relies on clang anyway, so not this is not as interesting as MSVC.)\r\n - Coverage reports #705 \r\n - Reducing configuration options to keep the test matrix manageable, see e.g., https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/596#issuecomment-495908309\r\n\r\nIs there anything else you would like to see?\r\n\r\nIf we want to work on this, this is a good time to think about the CI platform. I don't mind Travis and it's reasonably stable in the past months but if we think that a different (or additional) provider is a better fit, it's better to discuss this before we start working on these issues.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Bitcoin is currently looking into GitHub Actions for Windows at least:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17803\r\n",

      "body": "I think BE is basically solved in travis since there is s390 (lol).  It sounds like the arm is arm64 which is useful but less interesting than 32bit arm.\r\n\r\nThe big gaps I see in travis:\r\n\r\n*  You cannot usefully benchmark, so you can't watch for performance regressions-- the systems it runs on are wildly different in performance and wildly inconsistent in performance because they're VPSes which are concurrently running other loads.\r\n\r\n* Getting work product output not supported (seems like a workaround would be possible), meaning you can't get CI [coverage analysis](https://mf4.xiph.org/jenkins/job/opus-coverage/ws/coverage/index.html), or [static analysis reports](https://mf4.xiph.org/jenkins/job/opus-scan-build/ws/scan-build/current/index.html)... except via integrating with other services which creates an unnecessary disparity between the free software tools the developers can use locally and the (usually commercial) services that the project ends up beholden to.\r\n\r\n* Travis CPU time is extremely limited (the fact that the travis executors are slow disguises how limited it is, e.g. it takes minutes for what would be tens of seconds locally).  This means that stuff like automated fuzz testing at a scale which is likely to find interesting bugs is essentially off the table, at least as part of CI tests.  This also clearly distorts testing priorities, with stuff like not using valgrind or cutting down tests just to fit under travis' limits.\r\n\r\nTo me the obvious thing to do is to run a jenkins instance. Jenkins is extremely simple to operate (in my experience much easier to use than travis, because you're less subject to trial and error-- particularly because if you're the group running it you can just ssh in and try the tests locally until they work).  Jenkins supports remote executors (and you can confine jobs to only run on particular executors), so its trivial to have an executor that runs on dedicated hardware that allows benchmarking... or on fast systems.\r\n\r\nThe big challenge I see is that the travis ecosystem has created an expectation that PRs from random people will get CI run against them.   And having random people's code run on your own hosts/networks is super scary.  One option would be to just run the jenkins on PRs by whitelisted people and on merged commits (this is apparently a standard feature of the jenkins PR integration module, which I've never used-- my experience has been w/ just running it on merged commits).   I can offer to run some executors (and can do arm7, big endian systems, whatever) on an isolated network that just vpns back to the jenkins install and has no network access.  But the limitation there is that if I get hit by a bus you might have issues finding someone else willing to volunteer a half rack of assorted old hardware.\r\n\r\nAn extension of the \"cant benchmark\" is that the library _really_ should have regression tests for sidechannel behaviour. Right now someone could flip a compiler flag, and the cmovs some being constant and you get an enormous sidechannel and no one would notice until it shows up in an attack (or hopefully, attack paper).   There are a couple different ways of dealing with that which would allow CI integration of a sidechannel test, but most of them require being able to use test on bizarre hardware (e.g. with a jenkins remote executor).  The one option that wouldn't would be running tests in a cycle accurate cpu simulator-- essentially like running in valgrind but could get cycle counts and dram access traces as a side effect which could be compared across different secrets to be sure they were constant, but when I went down that path a couple years ago none that I could find simulated dram. @tdaede might have more recent suggestions.\r\n\r\n",

But it seems that the project is dead soon (no activity in their github repo, not even activity or replies on twitter). So I don't think we'll be happy with this for long.\r\n - do our own thing (e.g., Jenkins run by @gmaxwell )\r\n - look into other CIs, e.g., Azure Pipelines\r\n\r\nNon-options:\r\n - github actions: not suitable for bitcoin core and I don't think we should have a different position: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17803#issuecomment-570317499\r\n\r\n\r\nedit: Azure is not good either:\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-11-11 11-39-24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1071625/98801945-dc5c9b80-2412-11eb-9519-cf98c92003a3.png)\r\n",

      "body": "Any public \"free\" solution is going to either be short lived or extremely stingy with cpu time for obvious economic reasons-- or, likely, both.  Any \"custom rolled\" solution has the life limits from their sponsors not having time for maintenance, hardware failures, etc. but presumably wouldn't be cpu resources limited. Custom rolled can also guarantee uncontested access to systems, allowing for real benchmarking.  \r\n\r\nI suggest regardless: All testing should be setup as generic shell scripts (and/or python if really needed) that could be invoked from any CI system-- they're pretty much there already except for the travis matrixing.  Then it becomes easier to move things around.\r\n\r\nThe project isn't just limited to just using one thing. If some free hosted thing works then it would probably good to run it in parallel with whatever else gets setup.\r\n\r\n[I would already have a jenkins setup running but for ongoing power usage limitations here which are finally almost resolved.]\r\n\r\n> We need to move s390x to qemu but native s390x is unreliable on Travis anyway\r\n\r\nI don't think having s390x is particularly important, esp since it's slightly broken for reasons out of our hands-- but having a BE target is nice.  Debian on MIPS BE (with valgrind too) and Sparc  run fine in qemu-system though both quite slow, and I assume BE PPC works but I haven't tried it. ...and each of these is way more important than s390x:  They're all found in really cool spacecraft. I don't know where s390x machines are found, but certainly not in space. Armonk, New York, probably. Space is much better than Armonk: For one thing, space doesn't have any computer crackers.\r\n",

We run `make check` which runs `./tests` and `./exhaustive_tests` in parallel and write their outputs in log files. That means, when `./tests` fails, the `make check` thing is red and then you click on it but you don't see any real error message. Instead, the real error is in a green section below. (See downstream example: https://cirrus-ci.com/task/6253397255913472?command=cat_tests_log#L4) Not a huge deal but simply not great for people who don't know what's going on. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe could simply run the tests without `make check` but then we don't test the automake part of `make check`. Maybe we can grep the log files for `PASS` or `FAIL` and make the \"cat\" script fail depending on this.",
