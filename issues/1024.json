Recovered pubkey is also incorrect. Instead `ecdsa_recover` returns 1 which seems to contradict with documentation. But maybe I'm missing something ? ",

If it's specific issues with the library (like https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1013) then here is better.\r\n\r\nAnyway I think the distinction is somewhat fuzzy, and also it may be hard to tell where the questions belongs for the person asking it (because they don't know the answer yet). Note that there's also #secp256k1 on libera chat IRC. \r\n\r\nClosing here because the question has been answered.",
