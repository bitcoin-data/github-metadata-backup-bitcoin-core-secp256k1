    "title": "Scalar / Point blinding",
    "body": "Constant time, constant memory access operations for secret data should make additional blinding unnecessary. But at least init-time static blinding can be done basically at no cost by baking it into the tables; and may afford some protection against EMI/power side-channels or timing in cases where a compiler has undermined the constant time operation.\n\nWe already do the novel unknown discrete log blinding. I'd held off previously adding more because we didn't have a hash function (e.g. to generate random unknown points for each table row). But we do now. Peter has also expressed some interest here.\n",
