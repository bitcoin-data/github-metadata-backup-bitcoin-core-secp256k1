    "body": "Constant time, constant memory access operations for secret data should make additional blinding unnecessary. But at least init-time static blinding can be done basically at no cost by baking it into the tables; and may afford some protection against EMI/power side-channels or timing in cases where a compiler has undermined the constant time operation.\n\nWe already do the novel unknown discrete log blinding. I'd held off previously adding more because we didn't have a hash function (e.g. to generate random unknown points for each table row). But we do now. Peter has also expressed some interest here.\n",

We should probably change the API to use a context pointer created by start, and could change start to take a random uchar[32] at that time.\n",
