    "body": "\r\nFrom IRC:\r\n\r\n`<roconnor>` The documentation for secp256k1_fe_equal_var suggest both inputs have to have magnitude 1; however only the first input needs to have magnitude 1.\r\n`<roconnor>` thus this call to fe_normalize_weak could be eliminated.\r\n`<roconnor>` But it is so very not critical, I'm not sure it is even worth PRing.\r\n`<real_or_random>` roconnor: same thing happens in secp256k1_gej_eq_x_var which is used in ECDSA verification. but ok, the speedup is still negligible \r\n`<real_or_random>` but I believe it's worth a PR (or an issue) because it would improve the internal docs",
