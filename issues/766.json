      "body": "Actually, I was not using the code as is, so I don't have the setup to test the issue in the current code itself.  I actually found this bug because I was re-using code from the library in a small home project, where I have field elements not using nails (packed in 32 bytes, like the scalars).  I do this in my project because I mainly want to use the GPU to do some computations and it help using packed binary representation (I use secp256k1 code mainly as a 'helper', the bulk of the computation will be GPU).\r\n\r\nSo, I had to modify the field code to look like the scalar code, but using modulo P instead of modulo N.  Most code mainly just involved using P instead of N as a constant, but I had to re-write the asm for the 512-bit reduction (much simpler as you only have one 64-bit single-precision multiplication).   However, at some point, I hit the issue with the clobber list as it was defined in scalar code (segfault).  Looking at asm output, I saw that the compiler did put the 'extract to m2' to %rsi, and since %rsi was used as indexed memory source for the next instruction, this caused segfault.  Just defining m0~m2 output list as early-clobber (since the %rsi input is not 'consumed' before those outputs are set) fixed the issue.\r\n",
