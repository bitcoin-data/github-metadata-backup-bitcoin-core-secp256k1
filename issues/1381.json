    "title": "Policy for VERIFY_CHECK and #ifdef VERIFY  ",
    "body": "### Current situation\r\n\r\nThe purpose of `VERIFY_CHECK(cond)` is to assert `cond` in test builds, i.e., when `VERIFY` is defined. While `cond` is supposed to have no side effects, `VERIFY_CHECK` will evaluate it even in production builds, to make sure that no side effects are masked in production builds.\r\n\r\nIn the case of simple `cond`, we can rely on the ability of the compiler to detect that `cond` has no side effects and to omit its evaluation entirely. However, many recently introduced `cond` are neither simple nor have negligible computation costs. In this case, we usually wrap `VERIFY_CHECK(cond)` in an `#ifdef VERIFY` block, which forces the evaluation to be omitted in production, at the cost of foregoing the aforementioned \"side-effect safety\" of `VERIFY_CHECK`. [1]\r\n\r\nOn top of this, we now have (full) functions like `secp256k1_fe_verify`, which internally perform `VERIFY_CHECK`s.\r\n\r\nI don't think anything we currently do is wrong, but sometimes the borders are a bit arbitrary, and with a mix of `#ifdef VERIFY` and no `#ifdef VERIFY`, and a mix of uppercase and lowercase, also readability and consistency suffer.\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to forcing evaluations to be omitted, we can either keep the current convention and force omitting on a case-by-case basis. Alternatively, we could just always force omitting, e.g., by defining `VERIFY_CHECK` to be empty in production. That will keep things simple and save us the decision of whether to force omitting. The comment in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/904#issuecomment-1540601651 appears to agree with this.  \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to readability, I think that `#ifdef` blocks tend to clutter the code. If we redefine `VERIFY_CHECK` to be empty in production, we could omit many `#ifdef` lines. Even if we keep two types of `VERIFY_CHECK`s, I suggest introducing a separate macro instead to replace `#ifdef`.\r\n\r\nOne remaining purpose of the `#ifdef`s is to highlight the test code blocks, e.g., [when we call `secp256k1_fe_verify` in `field_impl.h`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/c545fdc374964424683d9dac31a828adedabe860/src/field_impl.h#L34-L45). But then we could just make these function names uppercase. And if we want blocks/grouping for better readability, we can simply use empty lines instead of `#ifdef` lines.\r\n\r\nSo I suggest \r\n - redefining `VERIFY_CHECK` to be empty in production\r\n - renaming `_check` functions to uppercase. \r\n \r\nAnd while we're touching this anyway, we could consider renaming \"check\" to \"assert\", which is a more precise term. (In fact, if we redefine `VERIFY_CHECK` to be empty in production, we have almost reimplemented `assert.h`...)\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[1] One idea was to improve this situation was to introduce a C hack that will tell us whether a compiler is able to determine that a `check` has no side effects, but I agree with https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/904#issuecomment-1540601651 that this is not the way to go. In addition to the points brought up by @sipa, relying on the compiler is just very brittle, with optimizations depending on compiler versions and flags.\r\n",

The remaining commits are unchanged, though some (easy-to-solve) conflicts appeared through cherry-picking. The last commit which actually removes the `normalize_weak` calls is obviously the critical one and needs the most attention for review.",

      "body": "Adding to the current situation is that VERIFY_CHECK is not side-effect safe when built with `--enable-coverage` which lead to bugs in coverage mode in the past. In fact, there are again unused variable warnings right now when compiling master with `--enable-coverage`. So an additional advantage of your suggestion is that VERIFY_CHECK in coverage mode isn't special anymore which would hopefully reduce maintenance of that mode.",

      "body": "Agree, I think we should make `VERIFY_CHECK` compile to nothing in non-VERIFY mode. It was worthwhile to aim for side-effect freeness, but the way to codebase has evolved I believe makes the benefit not worth the cost. As pointed out in #904, the benefit is effectively restricted already to the simplest cases, where arguably it doesn't matter much anyway.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't actually rename the `verify_` *functions* to be upper case, but instead leave them as lowercase functions, but with an uppercase macro around them (maybe one that also compiles to nothing in non-VERIFY mode, so that not even a dummy `verify_` function is needed in that case). This is just for style reasons - I think it's good that a reader can guess what is a function and what is a macro just on the name.",
