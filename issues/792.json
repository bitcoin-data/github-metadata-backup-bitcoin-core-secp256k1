    "body": "> I think it's reasonable to require a two's complement implementation (we could verify it in a configure script, and in unit tests)\r\n\r\nIf you really have some exotic system, then you might not run ./configure or the tests either. I think the safest way is to use some C static assert hack e.g., https://stackoverflow.com/a/56742411. These looks very ugly but they work and the ugliness is hidden behind a macro. We should also check other simple assumptions such as `sizeof(int) == 4` etc. Alternatively, we could perform some self-tests at context creation time, and call the error callback if they fail. The simple ones will be optimized away by the compiler, and we should have some kind of self-test anyway if we want to implement a SHA256 override (see the discussion in #702).\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @real-or-random in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/767#issuecomment-670979922_\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell notes there that the static assert hack may not be the best idea.

In the precompiler we don't have sizeof  (and we can't emulate it because struct padding is unknown etc). In the static assert hack, we can't check for overflow. Maybe it's best to simply set the maximum to something like 10 if SIZE_MAX is smaller than UINT32_MAX.  That's not precise but should be good enough in practice. What window size did you use for your 16-bit tests?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n> Nope, test_fixed_wnaf_small has some bugs where it uses 32-bit values as int arguments\r\n\r\nAre you willing to fix these?",
