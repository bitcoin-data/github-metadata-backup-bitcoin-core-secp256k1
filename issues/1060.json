To avoid duplication, there could be a field_debug.h that implements these by \"wrapping\" the underlying field. It could be done by giving all field types/functions a suffix, and if debug is in use, have the real field functions forward to those, and if not, just `#define fn fn_suffix` for all.\r\n\r\nOne reason for not doing this would be if we want to make group logic dependent on what the used field is (e.g. a field with laxer magnitude requirements could result in the group code emitting fewer normalization calls).",

      "body": "I'm in favour of enforcing consistent limits across the field implementations. Although I don't particularly like adding the extra \"layer\", perhaps it does make more sense to put those checks in a single place.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to see effort directed to #1001 first.\r\n\r\n> One reason for not doing this would be if we want to make group logic dependent on what the used field is (e.g. a field with laxer magnitude requirements could result in the group code emitting fewer normalization calls).\r\n\r\nThis is becoming less and less likely IMO. For one thing, our group methods are improving with respect to the output magnitudes, and #1032 would eventually let us drop several normalize calls at entry anyway. Actually I think these will soon be normalization-free (ignoring the _normalizes_to_zero checks that aren't about magnitude reduction).\r\n\r\nSecondly, the main constraint for normalization is the input magnitudes for _fe_mul/_fe_sqr. We can actually improve that to 16 (from the current 8) for the 5x52 and 10x32 implementations by:\r\n1. _fe_mul/_fe_sqr leave their final carry in the most-significant-limb.\r\n2. limbs except for the MSL have their bound halved (i.e. the bound becomes M*(2^52-1) for 5x52 field).\r\n3. one or two other field methods probably need to be adjusted accordingly; last time I tried this it was only _fe_negate.\r\n\r\nThe 5x52 C mul/sqr are already consistent with this. One of my other PRs included that behaviour for the 10x26 C mul/sqr, but had a (slight) performance impact on some platforms (probably ignorable). The blocker for this is currently updating the asm implementation(s).\r\n\r\nEven though I think 16M inputs to mul/sqr is a nice thing to have, the only performance impact I could easily see was to eliminate (IIRC) 2 normalizations from _gej_add_ge, and they may already be gone! Therefore I don't expect any gains from saved normalizations by having field-implementation-specific code. Perhaps one sunny day someone will e.g. want to sum a long list of field elements, and the most sensible thing to do then would be to give them a new field method I think.\r\n",

For example in `ecmult` (the variable-time one), the exact code path (and the corresponding operations on field elements) are dependent on the input scalar.

      "body": "When control flows join the effective magnitude (which is a bound) is the worst-case of all of them, except for complicated scenarios where past and future branches aren't independent of each other.\r\n\r\nIt might be worth providing a method to make that an explicit operation (asserting a magnitude limit and actually setting the magnitude to that limit). This parallels the original logic of secp256k1_fe_cmov (which, in passing, hasn't been restored, though I believe there was an issue tracking it).\r\n\r\nAlthough any given branch is likely to get code coverage, it's more difficult to cover all combinations of branches, so I think this would be valuable. I guess one could contrive a scenario where performance would be slightly affected (implying an extra `_normalize_weak_var`), but it doesn't strike me as significant.",
