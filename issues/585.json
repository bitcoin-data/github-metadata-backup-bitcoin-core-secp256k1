    "body": "It looks like your project uses the \"restrict\" keyword. Both GCC since version 5 (https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=87609) and CLANG for some time (https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39282) can miscompile restrict-tagged pointers especially when called in loops/inlining. Seems \"restrict\" shouldn't be used in modern C.",
