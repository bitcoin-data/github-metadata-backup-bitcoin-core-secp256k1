    "body": "**edit: This is now more a meta issue to discuss an improved context API, see the discussion below.**\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm arguably late to the party but I believe we should either talk about this now (before we do a release) or never:\r\n\r\n> Taking a step back, I believe that even given the problems with C, upstream's API is not optimal here. A better API would be to ask the user to provide entropy already in `_context_create`, or pass NULL explicitly to opt out.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @real-or-random in https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-secp256k1/issues/225#issuecomment-655998672_\r\n\r\nNote that this does not need to be a breaking change, we could for example add a new function and deprecate `secp256k1_context_create`.",

Now the signing context is essentially just the randomness.  It would make a lot more sense in my view to now make signing contexts non-shared, and then they could advance their random state on each use,  and it would also be reasonable to generate randomness at creation time.\r\n\r\nThe problem I see with that is that the verify contexts still have huge expensive to create precomputed tables, and one probably doesn't want to have to generate a new one all the time... so it makes sense to share them.

We should keep this for sure, but it may still make sense to expect the randomness at context creation time.\r\n\r\n> Ideally every signature would advance blinding to a new state, but doing that would write to the context, and the existing interface allows you to use the context from multiple threads.\r\n> \r\n> This made more sense when the signing context had large and expensive to create precomputed tables in it rather than the tables being static. Now the signing context is essentially just the randomness. It would make a lot more sense in my view to now make signing contexts non-shared, and then they could advance their random state on each use, and it would also be reasonable to generate randomness at creation time.\r\n\r\nIndeed. Last time we discussed this, we didn't have a good idea how to do this because of the expensive multiplication. Maybe we could have something like what I mentioned here: http://gnusha.org/secp256k1/2020-07-08.log (I think @sipa mentioned this idea earlier somewhere).\r\n\r\n> \r\n> The problem I see with that is that the verify contexts still have huge expensive to create precomputed tables, and one probably doesn't want to have to generate a new one all the time... so it makes sense to share them. This wouldn't be a big deal, except sign & verify contexts exist.\r\n\r\nI don't think that's a big deal either. You could make combined contexts non-shared too. If the user wants more concurrency, they can just create separate contexts.\r\n",

      "body": "Right.  Even a single attacker unknown random increment should break most attacks, but a choice of two can be done for the runtime cost of a single additional CMOV and will leave the whole scalar totally randomized after a number of uses.\r\n\r\nAny of these power/emi sidechannel defences are inherently adhoc: nothing the library can do can make it strong against a sufficiently powerful sidechannel attacker.\r\n\r\nIf instead we assume the attacker can only manage to extract a few bits, then all the attacks that I'm aware of are extremely fragile and are easily broken. E.g. the quaint old bitcoin  'low-s' rule completely obliterates them-- because they depend on you utterly reliably identifying the most significant bit of the scalar.  They can't brute force the guess because they need hundreds of signatures with the correct guess.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these attacks are so fragile opens the door to disrupting them with fairly minimal means...\r\n\r\nThe main thing that I know to defend against attacker can get learn the power signature of multiplying with specific constants (e.g. which entries of the precomputed table). The random isomorphism makes it so the first multiplication isn't entirely constant at least, but at least two arguments to it are. \r\n\r\nSo the first defence is randomly blinding the scalar so that learning which table entries were accessed isn't that useful. But randomly blinding is expensive if you need an extra ecmult to update the blinding and that ecmult leaks too...  (though that's why the update should increment the blinder, not replace it).  \r\n\r\nI think if you really can tolerate a blinding that doubled the computational cost, you'd be better off just running two ecmults with the first or the second randomly the real one, and the other a dummy random one (or blinding update), and use cmovs in and out to get the real one output.   But that it just extremely expensive and I think hard to justify without measurements that say it helps and that something stupid isn't leaking everything.\r\n\r\nThe next obvious thing to do is to increase the size of the ladder some so that you compute a (say) 320-bit  x * G  and set x randomly so that x%N is the target scalar-- at least that isn't an arbitrary doubling. \r\n\r\nDettman had a patch to use random isomorphisms for the table, but to really make use of it the table needs to be writeable, and on just about any embedded device where power/emi sidechannels are an interesting attack will be pushed by memory pressure and init time to keep the table in flash instead of ram.  Though it would be reasonable to apply it build time at least-- better than nothing and the attacker might not have access to the build (e.g. gen_context picking the random isomorphism).\r\n\r\nGoing back on the theme of limited measures being effective against the known attacks which are less powerful than just reading everything (which we're hopeless against)--  Choice of negation and endomorphism gives 2.58 bits of entropy,  e.g. randomly scale the scalar by  {1, beta, beta^2, -1, -beta, -beta^2} for the low low cost of two scalar multiplies, three scalar cmovs, one scalar conditional negate, two field multiplies, three field cmovs, and one field conditional negate.\r\n\r\nI wish the nonce function it was using naturally gave a somewhat larger output. :-/  even just a couple bits to drive a random scaling factor and/or pick one of two random updates to the blinder.\r\n",

      "body": "Ok, so I still think that having something like `secp256k1_context_create_randomized` would be a small improvement but in the end then the current API is pretty reasonable then and I don't think we should change it now. \r\n\r\nWe should really think about automatic rerandomization but as discussed here this will imply that signing contexts can't be used concurrently. This will be a major change, and so it should not be silent, and we would anyway need to break the API and rename functions etc. This deserves some more thoughts:\r\n - Do we want to split signing/verification contexts entirely?\r\n - Is signing/verification the right terminology now that we have other operations (ECDH, tweaking) that require contexts?\r\n - Are the context creation flags the most ergonomic API?\r\n - ...\r\n\r\nI think that's nothing that we want to do for the initial release then. I'm renaming the issue then. If there's interest, we could still introduce \"cheap\" randomization already with the existing API, e.g., by adding a `context_randomize_cheap` or similar.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?",

      "body": "Summarizing a long discussion on this from IRC ([The discussion](https://gist.github.com/elichai/19f23049108b4c66624c032c0e13facb), I edited out anything that wasn't related, I hope I didn't accidentally modified the discussion in any way)\r\nAfter #988 there will be 2 kinds of contexts left, and we might add another one with #967:\r\n1. illegal arguments and error callbacks\r\n2. Randomizing the signing operations for better side-channel resistance\r\n3. Determining CPU features in runtime for #967.\r\n\r\nSome ideas raised on how to handle these so we can remove the `context` argument from most of the public API:\r\n\r\n1. These can probably be removed since we have #595, but this might complicate the tests that check these callbacks.\r\n2. A. Should we make this context mutable (or add a `sign_with_randomize`) so that we can add randomization to it with every sign operation (harvest a single bit of entropy each time).\r\n    B. Should this context be `thread_local`(C11 and can complicate embedded) or implement something using atomics(C11) (We could for example, make a pool of contexts and mark them as currently used/unused and spinlock if they're all used)\r\n    C. Add a flag that says if it can assume thread safety or not, if yes re-randomize it with every operation, if not don't re-randomize it.\r\n3. Note that this will need to be done only once, and also dynamic dispatch might not be proven performant to do at the field operations level (as it will prohibit inlining) so we might need to do it on the EC operations level or even the API level.\r\n    A. We could use a `call_once`(C11).\r\n    B. We could use compiler extensions like `__attribute__((constructor))`([link](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.7.0/gcc/Function-Attributes.html))\r\n    C. We could use binary specific extensions like `.init_array` in ELF `.CRT$XIB` in EXE, and `__DATA,__mod_init_func` in MCH-O.\r\n    D. We could use architecture specific operations, for example in x86 movs to/from regular registers are always atomic, so we can call `cpuid` from inline assembly and write the result into a static variable from the assembly, that way we don't violate C data race rules.\r\n    E. Compile the library multiple times with different flags and somehow get the linker to use the right one (@gmaxwell said that's how libspeex works on debian/ubuntu)\r\n    \r\n    \r\nMy own opinions:\r\n2 -  we should probably do A and not B because users of this library can probably implement B more easily as they assume more things on their environment (single threaded, an OS etc.),\r\n3 - we should really try to avoid requiring the user to pass a context everywhere just for the cpuid results.",
