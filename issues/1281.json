    "title": "build: Move generation of prebuilt files out of build system",
    "body": " #1245 and its need for #1277 have shown that \"abusing\" autotools to generate prebuilt files is hard to understand, and remains hard to maintain. \r\n\r\n> With all this autotools mess, and since we don't even have these features in CMake, it would perhaps be cleaner to move (maintainer-)generation of the distributed files entirely out of the build system(s). This is currently hard since creating the files involves running a C program, which needs to be compiled, which needs some kind of build infrastructure. If we used Python to create the table files (see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/919), this would simplify some things. In particular because we have a \"maintainer dependency\" on Python anyway now with the test vector scripts.... On the other hand, all of this is work and I doubt it's worth spending our time on this right now.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @real-or-random in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1280#issuecomment-1514726159_\r\n",
