    "body": "I propose changing the benchmarks to measure CPU cycles instead of time. This way it is more portable, reliable and future proof. It is also more lightweight and realistic as it impacts the measurements less.\n\nIt probably isn't portable but there are libraries with nice #defines that abstract it away.",
