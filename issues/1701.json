    "body": "## Proposal: Replace Wall-Clock Time Measurements with CPU Cycle Counting in Benchmarks\n\n### Summary\n\nI propose replacing the current `gettimeofday()`-based timing measurements in the benchmark suite with CPU cycle counting using hardware performance counters (`RDTSC`). This change would significantly improve benchmark reliability, precision, and consistency.\n\n### Current Issues with Time-Based Measurements\nThe current benchmarking implementation in [bench.h](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/master/src/bench.h) uses wall-clock time measurements with microsecond precision:\n```c\nstatic int64_t gettime_i64(void) {\n    struct timeval tv;\n    gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);\n    return (int64_t)tv.tv_usec + (int64_t)tv.tv_sec * 1000000LL;\n}\n```\n\nThis approach has several significant limitations:\n\n1.  **Limited Precision:** Microsecond resolution is insufficient for modern CPUs where cryptographic operations can complete in hundreds of nanoseconds\n2.  **System Interference:** Wall-clock time is affected by:\n    *   OS scheduler interrupts and context switches\n    *   Other running processes competing for CPU time\n    *   Power management and frequency scaling\n    *   Thermal throttling\n3.  **High Variability:** Benchmark results can vary by 50%+ between runs due to system noise\n4.  **Non-deterministic:** Results depend on system load, making comparisons unreliable\n5.  **Overhead:** System call overhead affects measurement accuracy\n\n### Benefits of CPU Cycle Counting\nCPU cycle counting using RDTSC (Read Time-Stamp Counter) provides:\n1. **Sub-nanosecond Precision**: Hardware counters offer the highest possible temporal resolution\n2. **Immunity to System Interference**: Cycles are counted at the hardware level, unaffected by OS scheduling\n3. **Deterministic Results**: Same code will produce consistent cycle counts regardless of system load\n4. **Lower Overhead**: Single instruction vs. system call\n5. **Hardware-level Accuracy**: Direct measurement of actual CPU work performed\n6. **Better for Performance Analysis**: Cycles directly correlate with instruction efficiency\n7. **Better coordination with other devs**: Provides a stable, reliable metric for team-wide performance discussions and comparisons.\n\n### Proposed Implementation\nReplace the timing mechanism with CPU cycle counting:\n\n",
