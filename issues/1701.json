    "title": "[Benchmark] replace Wall-Clock Time with Per-process CPU Time",
    "body": "### Summary\n\nI propose replacing the current `gettimeofday()`-based timing measurements in the benchmark suite with CPU cycle counting using hardware performance counters (`RDTSC`). This change would significantly improve benchmark reliability, precision, and consistency.\n\n### Current Issues with Time-Based Measurements\nThe current benchmarking implementation in [bench.h](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/master/src/bench.h) uses wall-clock time measurements with microsecond precision:\n```c\nstatic int64_t gettime_i64(void) {\n    struct timeval tv;\n    gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);\n    return (int64_t)tv.tv_usec + (int64_t)tv.tv_sec * 1000000LL;\n}\n```\n\nThis approach has several significant limitations:\n\n1.  **Limited Precision:** Microsecond resolution is insufficient for modern CPUs where cryptographic operations can complete in hundreds of nanoseconds. Requiring a lot of iterations to get an acceptable result\n2.  **System Interference:** Wall-clock time is affected by:\n    *   OS scheduler interrupts and context switches\n    *   Other running processes competing for CPU time\n    *   Power management and frequency scaling\n    *   Thermal throttling\n    *   Shared caches between cores\n3.  **High Variability:** Benchmark results can vary by 50%+ between runs due to system noise\n4.  **Non-deterministic:** Results depend on system load, making comparisons unreliable\n5.  **Overhead:** System call overhead affects measurement accuracy\n6. **Lack of comparison**: doesn't provide a stable, reliable metric for team-wide performance discussions and comparisons.\n\n### Proposed Implementation\nUse clocks that don't include the time that the process is paused etc. I propose something like `clock_gettime(CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID)` or `perf stat -e cpu-clock`\n\n",
