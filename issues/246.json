    "body": "When exporting a private key, the compressed flag is required to create the correct DER key. \n\nI noticed that `secp256k1_ec_privkey_import()` only takes a pointer for a secret key. I think it should take an `int *` to inform whether the key should be serialized to its compressed representation. \n\nI'll try have a look see if it's a straightforward change, though my C isn't the best. Does this seem worthwhile, or was there perhaps a reason it doesn't do this? \n",
