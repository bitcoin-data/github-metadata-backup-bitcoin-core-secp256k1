Core has this too:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/SECURITY.md\r\n\r\nThis is also a good chance to think about the process, i.e., who should actually be informed about vulnerabilities in this library. This is not completely obvious since this library somehow belongs to Bitcoin Core (I mean the software, not the \"organization\"/group of people) but on the other hand is maintained separately.",

Ideally secp256k1-security would just forward to the three maintainers listed in SECURITY.md. @sipa @apoelstra is it okay to put you there? Fwiw I'm opting out for now because three people should be enough.\r\n\r\n@sipa do you know who to talk to about adding secp256k1-security@bitcoincore.org and the specifics about how it would work?",
