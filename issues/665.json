      "description": "Motivation: libsecp is already widely used today, but often in a terribly outdated version. It's likely that a release process would help with that. Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",

      "body": "This is a good suggestion and I agree that it would be really useful if the ECDH module would graduate from being experimental. It's already used by a few projects (elements, clightning, ...) but if they depend on an experimental module, they can be viewed themselves as experimental. But at some point the software used in the Bitcoin space must mature beyond that.\r\n\r\nOne thing that marking the module as experimental is expected to do a moderately good job at is scaring developers not familiar with applied cryptography away from using low-level primitives like ECDH. However, \"experimental\" and \"unsafe-if-used-incorrectly\" are different qualities. See also the discussion in #352.\r\n\r\nAPI-wise the module seems relatively stable. There's #262, #352 and ~#363~, which would require a different API, but as far as I can see they could be added as additional functions instead of changing the existing `secp256k1_ecdh` arguments.\r\n\r\nMost importantly though, I don't know how much the code was reviewed. While the ECDH module is very small, it uses `ecmult_const` which isn't used by anything else. I have not read it. In particular, it would be important that the function is actually constant-time, which could be investigated with tools like ctgrind or sidefuzz in addition to code review.",

There's #262, ~#352~ and #363, which would require a different API, but as far as I can see they could be added as additional functions instead of changing the existing `secp256k1_ecdh` arguments.\r\n\r\nWe should think about closing these PRs if we're currently not interested in them.
