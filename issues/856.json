    "body": "On our path towards a 1.0 release it would help to start with a 0.1 release soon. Ideally, we'd do this in a systematic way and first discuss how we want the process to look like initially.\r\n\r\nIt would make sense for the process to be similar to Bitcoin Core's. Here are some suggestions, based on my understanding of [bitcoin-maintainer-tools/make-tag.py](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools/blob/a9eaddb7397f149121a4225b4096b04918d20362/make-tag.py) and [bitcoin/doc/release-process.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f7b93047581c67f2133cdb8c7845471de66c30f/doc/release-process.md).\r\n\r\nWe would copy the start of Core's [configure.ac](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/dca80ffb45fcc8e6eedb6dc481d500dedab4248b/configure.ac#L10) into ours:\r\n```\r\ndefine(_CLIENT_VERSION_MAJOR, 0)\r\ndefine(_CLIENT_VERSION_MINOR, 99)\r\ndefine(_CLIENT_VERSION_BUILD, 0)\r\ndefine(_CLIENT_VERSION_RC, 0)\r\ndefine(_CLIENT_VERSION_IS_RELEASE, false)\r\n```\r\nand replace our `AC_INIT` with\r\n```\r\nAC_INIT([libsecp256k1],m4_join([.], _CLIENT_VERSION_MAJOR, _CLIENT_VERSION_MINOR, _CLIENT_VERSION_BUILD)m4_if(_CLIENT_VERSION_RC, [0], [], [rc]_CLIENT_VERSION_RC))\r\n```\r\nWe can print the version at the end of the configure script and a warning if `RELEASE` is not true.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow in order to create a release candidate we\r\n\r\n1. Start [writing release notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-process.md#write-the-release-notes)\r\n2. Create a corresponding release branch\r\n    1. Create a commit to fix the `VERSIONS` in configure.ac (including `RC=1`)\r\n    2. Tag the commit with a version of make-tag.py that's adapted to libsecp\r\n    3. Create github release\r\n3. To create a new release candidate repeat steps 2.i through 2.iii\r\n4. Once we're happy with the release candidate\r\n    1. Archive the release notes for the new version to doc/release-notes/ (branch master and branch of the release)\r\n    2. Create commit to set `IS_RELEASE` to `true` and `VERSION_RC` to `0`\r\n    3. Tag the release\r\n    4. Create a new GitHub release with a link to the archived release notes\r\n\r\nThis doesn't look as simple as I would have hoped, but it's not terrible. What do you think?\r\n\r\n\r\n",

What do you think?\r\n\r\nI agree with this sentiment. \r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure about having release candidates. But I think this will help us coordinate testing better. At the moment it's a little bit arbitrary though the quality is good enough that every state that lands on master is a release in a sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Relation to Core\r\nWe should then think about when the canonical point should be to update the tree in Core\r\n * Updating the Core tree after a release sounds natural and is certainly a good idea.\r\n * Updating the Core tree after a RC will get us some more testing (and maybe feedback on the API).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Versioning Scheme\r\nAn aspect that we should talk about is the versioning scheme. I don't have a lot of experience in this but libtool can do some rather complex stuff:\r\n * https://stackoverflow.com/a/20355237\r\n * https://autotools.io/libtool/version.html \r\n  \r\nI wonder how this is related to https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/817. It's for sure related to #844, which I'm only realizing now. ",

          "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nToday we have the ability to install `libbitcoin` and other core bitcoin libraries via homebrew but it builds and installs `libsecp256k1` as a private library.  I'm working both on moving `libsecp256k1` to it's own formula so it can be used independently of `libbitcoin` as well as `ruby-secp256k1` as native bindings for Ruby.  In order to support this we need to be able to refer to a cut release of `libsecp256k1`.  While I understand that it is not v1 yet, cutting a v0.8 or v0.9 for the non-experimental modules of core, ecdh, and recovery would enable wider adoption and contributions to this library.\r\n\r\nThe ask is to create a pre v1 release for homebrew.",

To keep it simple, there is no concept of release candidates for now.\r\n\r\nThe release version is determined by semantic versioning of the API. Since it does not seem to be a lot of work, it is proper to also version the ABI with the libtool versioning system. This versioning scheme (semver API, libtool versioning ABI) follows the suggestion in the [autotools mythbusters](https://autotools.io/libtool/version.html).\r\n\r\nExperimental modules are a bit of a headache, as expected. This release process suggests to treat any change in experimental modules as backwards compatible. That way, users of stable modules are not bothered by frequent non-backwards compatible releases. But a downside is that one must not use experimental modules in shared libraries (which should be mentioned in the README?). It would be nice if we could make the schnorrsig module stable in the not too distant future (see also #817).\r\n",
