    "title": "ULL constants are not C89",
    "body": "The README states as a goal: \"Intended to be portable to any system with a C89 compiler and uint64_t support.\"\r\n\r\nThe C89 syntax does not specify `unsigned long long` (`ULL`) constants because there is no requirement that a `unsigned long long` type exists. We use `ULL` in a few places, e.g.:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/39198a03eaa33d5902b16d3aefa7c441232f60fb/src/scalar_4x64_impl.h#L11\r\n\r\nWe should replace `ULL` with the `UINT64_C` macro from in `stdint.h`. Note that `UL` is not an issue: It's in the C89 syntax and `unsigned long` is guaranteed to have at least 32 value bits, so we can use it for `uint32_t` constants. We may still want to change it for consistency and readability (clearer expression of intent).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can do nothing (because noone seemed to care about this so far).",

This sounds pedantic (and I admit that this issue is pretty pedantic), but the presence of additional headers is not just theoretical. The GCC docs say: \"<stdint.h> is provided by GCC (as of version 4.5), or fixed where the system headers provide a nonconforming version, on some but not yet all systems.\", see https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/c-status.html#c99 .\n\nSo the reason why the README mentions C89 is that C89 + `stdint.h` suffices. You don't need \"full\" C99...  Does this matter in 2025? Probably not. Have we ever seen a compiler that does not support `ULL`? No.\n\nI still think that something like https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/746 is useful, if only for the reason that `UINT64_C(0xaa..aa)` is simply the right thing to do if you want to specify a `uint64_t`. It's more portable, and it saves the reader the cognitive overhead of figuring out how `0xaa..aaULL` is converted to `uint64_t`. But none of this is high priority.\n",
