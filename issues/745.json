    "title": "ULL constants are not C89",
    "body": "The README states as a goal: \"Intended to be portable to any system with a C89 compiler and uint64_t support.\"\r\n\r\nThe C89 syntax does not specify `unsigned long long` (`ULL`) constants because there is no requirement that a `unsigned long long` type exists. We use `ULL` in a few places, e.g.:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/39198a03eaa33d5902b16d3aefa7c441232f60fb/src/scalar_4x64_impl.h#L11\r\n\r\nWe should replace `ULL` with the `UINT64_C` macro from in `stdint.h`. Note that `UL` is not an issue: It's in the C89 syntax and `unsigned long` is guaranteed to have at least 32 value bits, so we can use it for `uint32_t` constants. We may still want to change it for consistency and readability (clearer expression of intent).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can do nothing (because noone seemed to care about this so far).",
