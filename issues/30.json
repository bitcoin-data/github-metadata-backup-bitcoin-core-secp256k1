      "body": "Somewhat related - is the GMP field considered a permanent fixture? I ask because in trying to optimize the point formulas I note that the effects on the GMP field are often opposite to the others. Generally the 32bit and 64bit fields reward reducing the amount of normalization, but GMP tends to reward normalising anything that will be input to more than one mul/sqr (maybe negate too).\n\nThere are conceivable, but sometimes fiddly, workarounds, so I'm just wondering if it's important to worry about GMP performance, or perhaps it's value is mainly as a sanity check?\n",
