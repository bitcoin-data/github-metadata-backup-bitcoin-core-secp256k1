    "title": "Magnitude in field implementation",
    "body": "Hello,\n\nI started to dig deeper into the implementation and stumbled over a small issue with the magnitudes.\n\nFrom `field_10x26_impl.h`, the function `secp256k1_fe_verify`\n\n```\n    r &= (a->magnitude >= 0);\n    r &= (a->magnitude <= 32);\n```\n\nwhile in `field_5x52_impl.h` the function is\n\n```\n    r &= (a->magnitude >= 0);\n    r &= (a->magnitude <= 2048);\n```\n\nThis means that multiplying a number with the constant value 100 is totally fine on a 64-bit machine, but will lead to an error on 32-bit machines, which IMHO is bad.  The two implementation should have the same external interface.\n\nFinally, is there a good reason for the `2 *` in the second line of `secp256k1_fe_verify`?  Why is the magnitude given in multiple of 2's?  Doesn't the code work with odd magnitudes?  This also means that one cannot express that magnitude should be 1 without having a fully normalized number.\n",
