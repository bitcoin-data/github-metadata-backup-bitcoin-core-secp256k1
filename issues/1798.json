    "title": "Documentation: GLV lattice constants are Eisenstein integer factors of group order",
    "body": "### Summary\n\nThe GLV decomposition in `scalar_impl.h` uses constants `a1, b1, a2, b2` that form the reduced lattice basis. These constants have a beautiful number-theoretic interpretation that is currently undocumented: they are exactly the **Eisenstein integer factors** of the group order `n`.\n\n### Background\n\nThe code already notes:\n```c\nLet l = -1/2 + i*sqrt(3)/2, the complex root of X^2 + X + 1.\n```\n\nWhat isn't mentioned is that `Z[l]` is classically known as the **Eisenstein integers** `Z[ω]`, studied by Gotthold Eisenstein in 1844. This ring has unique factorization, and primes `p ≡ 1 (mod 3)` split as `p = π·π̄ = a² + ab + b²`.\n\n### The Connection\n\nThe secp256k1 group order `n` factors in `Z[ω]` as:\n\n```\nn = N(π) = π · π̄   where   π = a - bω\n```\n\nUsing the standard Eisenstein norm `N(x + yω) = x² - xy + y²`, we have:\n```\nN(a - bω) = a² - a(-b) + (-b)² = a² + ab + b² = n\n```\n\nwhere:\n```\na = 303414439467246543595250775667605759171   (128 bits)\nb = 64502973549206556628585045361533709077    (126 bits)\n```\n\n**The GLV basis constants are exactly these Eisenstein factors:**\n\n| Constant | Value | Eisenstein factor |\n|----------|-------|-------------------|\n| a1 | `0x3086d221a7d46bcde86c90e49284eb15` | b |\n| -b1 | `0xe4437ed6010e88286f547fa90abfe4c3` | a |\n| a2 | `0x114ca50f7a8e2f3f657c1108d9d44cfd8` | a + b |\n| b2 | `0x3086d221a7d46bcde86c90e49284eb15` | b |\n\n### Verification (SageMath)\n\n```python\nn = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141\na = 303414439467246543595250775667605759171\nb = 64502973549206556628585045361533709077\n\n# Verify norm formula\nassert a^2 + a*b + b^2 == n  # ✓\n\n# Verify in Eisenstein ring\nK.<w> = NumberField(x^2 + x + 1)\npi = a - b*w  # Note: π = a - bω\nassert pi.norm() == n  # ✓\n\n# GLV constants from libsecp256k1\na1 = 0x3086d221a7d46bcde86c90e49284eb15\nb1_neg = 0xe4437ed6010e88286f547fa90abfe4c3\n\nassert a1 == b      # ✓\nassert b1_neg == a  # ✓\n```\n\n### Why This Matters\n\n1. **Independent verification**: The constants can be verified through Eisenstein factorization, not just derived from Frobenius trace\n2. **Educational value**: Connects modern ECC optimization to classical algebraic number theory (1844)\n3. **Mathematical elegance**: The GLV lattice is literally the kernel of the ring homomorphism `Z[ω] → Z_n`\n\n### Suggested Documentation Addition\n\nAdd to the existing comment in `scalar_impl.h`:\n\n```c\n/*\n * Note: Z[l] is classically known as the ring of Eisenstein integers Z[ω],\n * studied by Gotthold Eisenstein (1844). The group order n factors in this\n * ring as n = N(π) where π = a - b*l is an Eisenstein prime with norm\n * N(a - b*l) = a² + ab + b². The lattice basis vectors {a1 + b1*l, a2 + b2*l}\n * correspond exactly to these factors: a1 = b, -b1 = a, a2 = a + b, b2 = b.\n *\n * This provides an independent verification path for the constants through\n * classical algebraic number theory.\n */\n```\n\n### References\n\n- Eisenstein, G.

      "body": "Re: practical value — I'd argue theory matters. First came the word, then the number, then cryptography. Gauss and Eisenstein didn't know their 1844 work on Z[ω] would end up in Bitcoin's scalar multiplication 180 years later. Documentation of such connections has educational value, even if it doesn't change the code behavior.\n\nThat said, your suggestion about `sage/gen_split_lambda_constants.sage` makes sense. Here's a standalone verification:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env sage\n\"\"\"\nEisenstein integer structure verification for secp256k1.\nDemonstrates that GLV constants arise from Z[ω] factorization of group order.\n\nReferences:\n- Gallant, Lambert, Vanstone (2001): \"Faster Point Multiplication on Elliptic Curves\"\n- Eisenstein (1844): \"Beweis der allgemeinsten Reciprocitätsgesetze\"\n\"\"\"\n\nn = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141\nLAMBDA = 0x5363ad4cc05c30e0a5261c028812645a122e22ea20816678df02967c1b23bd72\n\n# Eisenstein factors (from Cornacchia or direct search)\na = 303414439467246543595250775667605759171\nb = 64502973549206556628585045361533709077\n\n# 1. Norm equation: n = a² + ab + b²\nassert a**2 + a*b + b**2 == n\n\n# 2. In Z[ω]: π = a - bω is an Eisenstein prime with N(π) = n  \nK.<omega> = NumberField(x^2 + x + 1)\npi = a - b*omega\nassert pi.norm() == n\n\n# 3. GLV eigenvalue: λ = b/a (mod n)\nassert (b * inverse_mod(a, n)) % n == LAMBDA\n\n# 4. Verify λ is primitive cube root of unity\nassert (LAMBDA**2 + LAMBDA + 1) % n == 0\n\nprint(\"All verified.\")\n```\n\nThe key insight: `λ = b/a mod n` where (a, b) are Eisenstein factors satisfying `n = a² + ab + b²`. This connects the \"magic constants\" in `scalar_impl.h` to 19th century algebraic number theory.\n\nRe: LLM — I use a custom software stack with agents for research. This is part of a personal philosophical investigation into Semaev's summation polynomials and j=0 curve structure. The math is independently verified in SageMath regardless of how it was explored.",

This paper talks only about verifying EC mult within arithmetic circuits and not about simply computing them on \"ordinary\" computers. Perhaps the decomposition itself is too expensive to hope for a speed-up in ordinary EC mults? Any comments appreciated here. @Liam-Eagen\n",
