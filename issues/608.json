The main reasons are that the existing Java Native Interface (JNI) bindings would need way more work to remain useful to Java developers but the maintainers and regular contributors of libsecp are not very familiar with Java (and evidently are motivated enough to improve the situation). We don't know who relies on these bindings with the exception of ACINQ who have their own fork at https://github.com/ACINQ/secp256k1/tree/jni-embed/src/java (@sstone). Bitcoinj can optionally use the libsecp bindings.\r\n\r\nIdeally, there would be a separate repository owned by Java developers with just the bindings. Until this exists, Java developers relying on libsecp can use ACINQs fork or an older commit of libsecp.",
