    "body": "Instead of having two different systems for allocation, we should move to an alloc/init model.  We should use a fixed size context (the largest possible size) since this is sharable.  (maybe this is a compiler flag?)\r\n\r\nUse uninitialized static memory or call malloc yourself, this is the self managed model.  You would do this for self managed:\r\n`secp256k1_context* ctx = malloc(sizeof(secp256k1_context));`\r\nThen call `secp256k1_context_initialize(ctx, flags);`\r\n\r\nThis is consistent with how every other operation handles memory.  The caller provides it.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to provide an allocator to the initialize function. \r\n\r\nA deprecated convenance function using malloc / free to provide back compatibility can be used as well",
