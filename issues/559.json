          "body": " - Documents the changes made to contexts that came with the transition to only static tables\r\n - Rename the static context\r\n - Expose the self tests for users of the static context\r\n\r\nThese are user-visible changes, so this is also a testbed for the changelog. I refrained from linking to the PR as the template proposed for multiple reasons:\r\n - Including the PR title is not in line with the suggestions in https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/ What they do instead is really just describe what parts in the API have changed, and I tend to agree that this is better for the user. The PR title can be rather technical or saying not too much, and a PR can correspond to multiple changes (for example this PR).\r\n - I'd be open to Include a link to the PR but I feel it's a little bit annoying because you get the PR number only after creating the PR... Also I think the changelog is addressed to our users, not our devs. It should be just a log of user-visible changes (syntax and visible API behavior), so we anyway shouldn't include every PR. \r\n\r\nA normal strategy would be to create a release first, then make the API changes, but in this case, this would be somewhat confusing. The important thing here is the changes made to context flags and these are already for quite some time, so it makes sense to document these even for the initial release.",
