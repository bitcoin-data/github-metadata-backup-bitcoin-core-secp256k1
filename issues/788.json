So much for the math.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not sure whether `secp256k1_ecmult_const` is built to work with point with the point at infinity. (I believe no.) It's an internal function and it's currently only used in the ECDH code and there the point can't be infinity because the point was deserialized and we don't a serialization for infinity. If `secp256k1_ecmult_const` is not to be used with infinity, then we should probably document it.",
