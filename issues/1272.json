    "title": "Is CMake 3.13 absolutely required right now?",
    "body": "I see that the minimum required cmake has been increased to 3.13 ( #1230 #1238). I imagine this is necessary for the future but I don't see how it is needed for v0.3.1. Is it safe to reduce this back to 3.10?\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the flutter SDK recommends to remain with 3.10 for plugin authors. As mentioned when creating a new plugin:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# The Flutter tooling requires that developers have CMake 3.10 or later\r\n# installed. You should not increase this version, as doing so will cause\r\n# the plugin to fail to compile for some customers of the plugin.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could choose to ignore the suggested minimum by flutter or fork the library to reduce the minimum version. Others might have a similar compatibility issue and I don't know if it was premature to increase the required minimum version yet.",

      "body": "Hi @MatthewLM \r\n\r\nThanks for letting us know. Point taken about v0.3.1, though I'm afraid that would only encourage people to count on some [behavior that is likely to change](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1230) in order to take advantage of newer CMake. In fact, I'm going to use this as a plea to merge that PR :p\r\n\r\nSo while the bump is only superficial for now, I'd call the current situation an unfortunate mid-state between the bump and the features that take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nFor builders on older OS's, I suspect we'll continue to recommend the autotools buildsystem for quite a while. Out of curiosity, is there anything it lacks (other than convenience) that CMake allows for?",

      "body": "> I'm going to raise the minimum CMake version to 3.13 as most users of the plugin will likely have no issue.\r\n\r\nThanks for being flexible. I feel that's the way to go. I totally see that it makes sense for Flutter to recommend not to have stricter requirements than the base framework. But on the other hand, 3.10 is pretty old right now, and requiring 3.13 won't affect many users.\r\n\r\nThe way we see our CMake experiment is that a) it's a more modern alternative to GNU Autotools, and b) it simply makes integration in other CMake projects easier. If we'd give up on that \"modern\" part, we'd lose a) unfortunately. But it's already good to see that b) works out and could lead to more adoption of the library.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, 0.3.1 was a bit unfortunate. We wanted to get this release out quickly because it's a security fix, and releasing master is less of a pain backporting fixes to old releases. But I guess it was even the better choice to bump the CMake version earlier before more people start relying on the low version (as pointed out by @theuni). ",
