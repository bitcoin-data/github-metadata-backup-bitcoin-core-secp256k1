    "body": "I've just read the abstract to [Just a Little Bit More, \nJoop van de Pol and Nigel P. Smart and Yuval Yarom](http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/434).\n\nI'm not well versed in side-channel analysis, and I cannot tell from the abstract if that method could feasibly compromise secret bits when this library is used to generate signatures. I'm hoping for an explanation and/or discussion here about that.\n\nI propose these end results to close this ticket:\n\nIf this library _is_ vulnerable to this kind of side-channel analysis, document why in the README, then put the best mitigation on the roadmap.\n\nIf this library _is not_ vulnerable to that kind of analysis, then a concise comparison between OpenSSL and this library could motivate a transition in Bitcoin (or perhaps even improvements to OpenSSL or the wider ecosystem, if you're an optimist).\n",

      "description": "Motivation: libsecp is already widely used today, but often in a terribly outdated version. It's likely that a release process would help with that. Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",

I am somewhat worried that a sufficiently advanced optimizer in a compiler might make changes to the secp256k1 code that defeat the security of it.\n\nAn unlikely example is that the compiler might detect you are doing elliptic curve multiplication and replace your algorithm with wNAF, because that algorithm has the same outputs and side effects (where time is not considered a side effect).  It probably won't make such a big change, but it might make some changes on a smaller scale that have similar effects.\n\nI'm wondering if we can really be 100% safe against timing attacks when writing cross-platform code in C, or if we just settle for being almost always safe.\n",

So regardless of the standard, the docs may need to specify which compiler and options are known to preserve these feature goals.\n\nAdditionally, the \"runtime\" introduces further uncertainty; consider that any C code may be running on [emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten), virtual machines, emulators. Imagine that llvm introduces better support for constant time/memory, but this library is used on an emscripten stack. Now what new side channel vulnerabilities exist?\n\n(Yes, we can all groan and cringe at JavaScript emulators, but in K months when the entire plasmacloud runs completely in a cyber-blockchain-browser, our grandkids will laugh at our backwardsness.)\n\n**Edit:** Added links, and minor grammatical changes.\n",

      "body": "@DavidEGrayson the standard pretty much only says the results agree with the abstract machine; no promises are made with timing.  In practice the world is not (currently) that awful.\n\nBut writing the whole program in a macro assembler is not a realistic option for reviewability (demonstrated nicely by bugs in asm written ECC code elsewhere...).   A middle ground might would be writing the software however, and compiling to assembler for release, with static analysis to check the timing.\n\nEven checking the assembler (obvious we can't check everyone's and haven't built portable automation for checking it, but we've checked on our own systems)  is not sure to be enough as the processor pipeline is not promised by the architecture to be constant time, unfortunately (on desktops, there are some embedded devices where they timing is precisely specified).  Measuring with the TSC is potentially not adequate as it's subject to the pipeline too... meaning it's at least theoretically possible (translation: future CPUs will probably doom you) for the processor to maintain \"Apparent constant time\" with the TSC by nailing you.   DJB has been trying to get intel to promise some things, but it seems so far they've resisted.\n\nI have interval counters with 10ps single shot resolution, so I could try instrumenting a modern host sometime; though tapping onto a high-speed bus is likely to be pretty fussy.... really more interesting would be capturing high bandwidth (several GHz wide) power traces; but thats clearly beyond my ability.\n\nChecking the ASM is not as crazy as you might think, at least for a codebase this small; as you can cover a lot with pattern matching. So it's only _mostly_ crazy.  ... I'd worry in the rust examples that without any formal analysis for rust yet (or a mature, clearly sound compiler) that stunts like that might be more likely to introduce weird bugs in practice. \"Congrats; your code sends your funds into a black hole in perfectly constant time.\"  :(\n\nWe also have additional blinding in the works beyond the unknown discrete log stuff thats there already, which should reduce the potential for exposure somewhat. (E.g. so long as your word sized addition has no data dependance the result is still secret, even if multiplies or other things are not)... though the goal there is more about hardening against power analysis which is even harder to protect against.  That it might make things robust in the face of a timing disaster is just a bonus.\n\nFWIW, it might be worth mentioning that our current degree of protection on this front is partially a product of Yuval Yarom, who was kind enough to spare a moment to respond to our request back in November after we thought we were reasonably constant time, and took a look at our implementation and gave us some good additional citations and very helpful advice (in particular, we had previously assumed cacheline uniformity was enough). (I don't say this to suggest it's all fine or has been deeply audited by Yuval Yarom-- just mostly a credit where its due, and also to point out that we were taking the concern seriously).\n",
