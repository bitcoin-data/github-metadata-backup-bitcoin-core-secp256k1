      "body": "Ugh, I think what's happening here is that old versions of `AM_PROG_CC_C_O` really redefine `AC_PROG_CC` to print that error message (which is not really elegant).\r\nI don't have an authoritative source for now but grep this page for `AC_PROG_CC cannot be called` https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libevent/+/e867981d427db5e0b860d67485838e1f9e8c37da%5E!/ \r\n\r\nThis is then relevant as our \"CC_FOR_BUILD\" macros later rely on `AC_PROG_CC`...\r\n\r\nNow noone has noticed this so far since `AM_PROG_CC_C_O` is a noop in newer version (since Automake 1.14 released in 2013 but CentOS 7 is really on Automake 1.13... \r\nhttps://centos.pkgs.org/7/centos-x86_64/automake-1.13.4-3.el7.noarch.rpm.html)\r\n\r\nSo I believe these are our options:\r\n  * Remove the call to `AM_PROG_CC_C_O`. It can believe that people use Automake 1.13 but I don't think people will use compilers for which this check is relevant?! (How old are these compilers? Maybe @gmaxwell has some idea?)\r\n  * Add a workaround that makes a backup of `AC_PROG_CC` restores it after the call to `AM_PROG_CC_C_O`. I believe this works but it's a lot of hassle for that old compilers.\r\n  * Simply require Automake 1.14 . I don't think we should do this if this means the package won't compile on CentOS7.\r\n\r\n@theuni Feel free to jump in if you have better ideas.\r\n\r\n@HachikoT \r\nCan you include the output of `autoconf --version` and `automake --version` to be sure?\r\nIt would also be nice if you can confirm that removing the `AM_PROG_CC_C_O` line in `autoconf.ac` makes the issue disappear.\r\n",
