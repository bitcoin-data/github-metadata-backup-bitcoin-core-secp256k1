This makes it easier for people to look at the changes. \n\n> I ran the benchmarks (both with avx2 enabled, to see difference between auto-generated simd and manual simd). I ran benchmarks thoroughly to ensure every change was meaningful. I don't have an avx512 CPU so I'm unable to run some tests & benchmarks for the `secp256k1_fe_impl_get_b32` function. But it should be much faster as well.\n> \n> Code: [Raimo33/secp256k1@`simd`/src/field_5x52_impl.h](https://github.com/Raimo33/secp256k1/blob/simd/src/field_5x52_impl.h?rgh-link-date=2025-07-14T16%3A29%3A02.000Z) Benchmarks:\n> \n> [bench_diff.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21257349/bench_diff.pdf) \n\nHm, that doesn't draw a very consistent picture. Did you disable turbo boost? Do you know that you can increase the number of benchmark iterations by setting `SECP256K1_BENCH_ITERS`?\n\n\n> Keep in mind that the only file I changed was `field_5x52_impl.h`, Imagine the possible speedup by applying simd to all other files as well. I see a lot of room for improvement and I would have a lot of fun implementing it.\n\nI'm not sure. I assume this is the file with the biggest potential. Bigger improvements might be possible by changing the algorithms or even the data structure so that they're more amenable to vectorization. (No idea if this is possible; I haven't thought about this or read up on it.) ",
