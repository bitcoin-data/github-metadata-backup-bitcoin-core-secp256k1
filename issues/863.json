      "body": "> If you want the privacy of the wallet to be a multisignature scheme as well, you need SSS.\r\n\r\nNote that a somewhat naive method for small M and N is layered encryption.  E.g., in the most common case of 2-of-3 with `sk1`, `sk2`, `sk3`, you can derive corresponding symmetric keys `k1`, `k2`, `k3` and then store \r\n\r\n```\r\nEnc(k1, Enc(k2, desc))\r\nEnc(k1, Enc(k3, desc))\r\nEnc(k2, Enc(k3, desc))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we had public key encryption (PKE) in this library, you could also use this... (Or roll your own PKE using the ECDH implementation here.) I think chosen ciphertext attacks are not an issue, so you wouldn't even need a full ECIES, even though it's not hard to implement. To be honest, PKE shows up in a number of scenarios in the Bitcoin space, so this may be another primitive to consider, in particular given that we have ECDH.\r\n\r\nIn the future with Schnorr sigs, we'll hopefully have \"real\" threshold schemes, e.g., FROST which anyway will use SSS under the hood. Assuming this exists, you could simply derive an encryption key from the FROST key generation. Having said this, we'll need some SSS implementation anyway but I'm really not sure if it should be user exposed.\r\n\r\n",
