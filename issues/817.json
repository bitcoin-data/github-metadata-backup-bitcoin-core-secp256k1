This becomes inevitable in larger systems: in particular, c-lightning uses both libsecp and libwally. The latter includes libsecp, and you can't have two libraries with the same symbols, so c-lightning needs to use the libwally one. Packaging systems fix this, but they have the same problem: they must configure in everything.\r\n\r\nYou can have boutique builds that omit features for embedded use, sure. But the default will be kitchen sink.\r\n\r\nI know it's hard: labelling something experimental is a good way of avoiding commitment. But it is a mere fig leaf which doesn't work, and mature libraries don't get that luxury.\r\n\r\nIf you're not prepared to commit to an API (ideally an ABI too), you simply cannot include something. In that case, it needs to be a separate library (and if it gets folded in later, all the names have to change!).",

Currently our model (and that of Bitcoin Core) is to have large atomic changes in a single PR developed by a single party who addresses review comments over and over. And reviewers keep reviewing the same stuff because people don't want to commit and the PR takes forever to be merged. I believe it's easier to develop large changes in a separate feature branch (or fork), but then create small PRs against this feature branch to avoid that PRs become huge, and later create a single large PR against master. Some things are simply too large to be handled in a single PR. \r\n\r\nThis is what Bitcoin Core is effectively doing with secp256k1.\r\n\r\n(Sorry, this is somewhat off-topic.)",

      "body": "I think there are a few somewhat related issues here.\r\n\r\n### \"experimental\" used to not mean very much\r\n\r\nThis library wasn't well maintained for a long time, and that led to a few things remaining marked experimental for far longer than they should have been. This has improved lately, and ECDH (which was effectively stable for years) is about to be marked non-experimental (see #809). I think the ARM assembly will in the near future become non-experimental as well, but I'd like to see CI support for it.\r\n\r\nBeyond those two, the only remaining experimental feature is the recently-merged BIP340 support. It is experimental for two reasons:\r\n\r\n* There are a few discussions still ongoing that may impact the API (variable-length message support, batch validation) without changes to the (currently supported) part of the scheme. It's not impossible to just add new functions for these once they're worked out, but given the next point, I think this may not be needed.\r\n* It's very hard to be *sure* what exact semantics of BIP340 will actually activate on Bitcoin (or if it will at all), and if that ends up being different from what is implemented now, eventually this library will want to implement the final scheme. I think changes are very unlikely at this point, but it's also not exactly under our control.\r\n\r\nThis is all to say: I think our recent notion of what \"experimental\" is narrower now than what it has been for a long time, and for what is left, there are specific criteria for letting them graduate - not an open-ended noncommitment.\r\n\r\n### If you can't commit to an API, you can't include it.\r\n\r\nI disagree here. There are certainly packaging/compatibility complexities (see next point), but there shouldn't be a reason why software that uses a pinned version of their dependencies (through subtrees, submodules, commit hashes in dependency systems, ...) cannot use an experimental API. It works, it's tested and reviewed, and it's included in the library so that things can be developed against it - they just have to be prepared to, for now, adapt to API changes when updating.\r\n\r\nAs for leaving things in a branch... perhaps that is an approach, but may make it harder to start developing software that builds on it.\r\n\r\nI think experimental feature just means you can only use it in a controlled environment.\r\n\r\n### Linking issues when dependencies need overlapping features\r\n\r\nThis is a hard problem, though it's not restricted to experimental-ness - any kind of optionality in features can cause this problem. It's even worse when there are downstream projects that add extra functionality (e.g. secp256k1-zkp; what if you need the rangeproofs from there, but also BIP340 support from the current upstream master, while -zkp isn't rebased on top of that?).\r\n\r\nI feel that perhaps at some point it will be needed to support a compile-time option to add some prefix to all exported symbol names.\r\n\r\n### (Non-experimental) features should be default-on when possible\r\n\r\nIgnoring experimental features - whether you agree with them or not - perhaps this is the main point you're trying to convey? When there are stable features in a library that are optional, they will be enabled in generic builds, and even when pinned within projects due to the need to provide for multiple indirect dependencies (e.g. libwally as you point out).\r\n\r\nSo that's an argument to make them default-on, or even non-optional, to minimize the potential configuration combinations that end users may end up with.\r\n\r\nPerhaps ECDH is a good candidate to make default to on now because of that. I'm less certain about recovery, as it's something that (I personally think) should be discouraged from being relied on in new systems (potential patent concerns, and aggregation schemes being more powerful in general).\r\n\r\n",

We have two kinds of users: 1) projects that pin a commit (primarily Bitcoin Core but also others) and 2) projects that want a general library. \r\n\r\nNow what will happen for the latter? Distributions tend to enable all features because it makes sense to do so, (related: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/675) and I'm not sure if we can convince them from not enabling experimental features. Somebody will need the experimental feature, so distros will enable it.\r\n\r\nAssume we have something like semver. What kind of release is an API break in an experimental module?  Major release?  Then there is no difference to normal modules. Minor release? Then users of experimental modules will need to pin version numbers, which creates all kinds of issues in dependency managers etc.  \r\n\r\nThe only way I see is to exclude experimental features from the versioning, discourage distros from enabling experimental features, and recommend that users who need experimental modules should vendor the library/pin a commit. (And put all the blame on them if they don't stick to the policy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n> It's far from ideal, but I think having a feature that's just temporarily in an experimental state is a good middle road.

Can you explain how?\r\n\r\n\r\n@rustyrussell \r\n> For example, it seems (from rough reading) recovery could be moved out to a separate library if there are patent concerns which means it should never be a \"core\" thing.\r\n\r\nRecovery is not an experimental module.

      "body": "Experimental features just don't have any promises.  Breaking the interface for one isn't any kind of API break because no API commitment was made at all. It may not be possible to design a really good and safe API for something without actually also attempting to implement the something in an application and getting feedback from how it integrates. While that is going on there needs to be a mechanism to coordinate with the new application(s).\r\n\r\nThey could, for sure, be in a separately forked copy of the library-- but this software exists as a freestanding library rather than a directory in bitcoin-core in part because it was believed it would be easier maintained this way.\r\n\r\nI think this choice has, for whatever reason, panned out somewhat poorly, resulting in a outright dangerous lack of attention and-- at times-- a near total inability to move things forward (although lately it's been better).  It has also not resulted in a particularly large amount of of adoption by other users (with a few exceptions, e.g. libwally/c-lightning)-- instead obviously provably less secure alternatives are _ubiquitous_ in hardware wallets, as an example.  If the library was further split into more separately maintained things I don't believe an outcome other than abandonment is likely.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, there have been features such as ECDH where holding them to the safety and integrity standard used in the library would have simply precluded their development as before they existed had zero usage to justify the hundreds of man hours of review and testing needed to mature them.  Without the ability to have unsupported/test components the response to attempt to develop such things would be \"don't bother\".  Again, it could be developed somewhere else, but I suspect that would just end up forgotten and abandoned (or else, all development would move to that, leaving this side abandoned and just renaming the library you're taking issue with).\r\n\r\nI don't follow this separate library discussion. This library is a single compilation unit, it would be a single file library except its nicer to maintain split into modules.  The overall design depends pretty heavily on inlining, and none of the internal symbols are exported at all.  Exposing the internals directly would be contrary to the design principle of only providing safe, supported, \"complete cryptosystem\" interfaces as much as possible.\r\n\r\nHaving a configurable prefix-- as is pretty common other crypto libraries that are mostly copied rather than linked-- would probably be pretty useful.  The symbol naming is already pretty well set up for it because everything is already prefixed \"secp256k1_\", so that could just be the default prefix. Some thought would need to be given on how to handle the typedefs.\r\n\r\nAs far as \"supported but you probably shouldn't use it in new things\", perhaps:  Rename the relevant functions something with _deprecated_ in them, keep the original name as a wrapper but with __attribute((deprecated))  set on it.  Existing callers will change the name of their call to silence the warnings, thus getting notified.\r\n\r\n> And it's actually used within Bitcoin Core, so we need this.\r\n\r\nIt's used only by \"signmessage\" -- nowhere by the bitcoin protocol. And signmessage is increasingly useless because it doesn't work with the address types mostly being used by users today, and without using the same addresses there is almost no justification for using signmessage over, say, PGP or signify...  I think it's likely that bitcoin would (eventually) drop signmessage if any of the several efforts to make an alternative that worked more generally were finished.\r\n",

      "body": "@gmaxwell Actually, libsecp is becoming widely used; every lightning implementation uses it, for example.  And the schnorr stuff is likely to complete this dominance, since it's just Damn Nice for any new uses.\r\n\r\n> Similarly, there have been features such as ECDH where holding them to the safety and integrity standard used in the library would have simply precluded their development as before they existed had zero usage to justify the hundreds of man hours of review and testing needed to mature them.\r\n\r\nThat... doesn't help me.  I'm using it.  I do not treat it any differently from the rest of libsecp256k1.  If it had, at least, been a separate library I might have (for example, auditing the code).  You're certainly implying that I should have!\r\n\r\n> This library is a single compilation unit, it would be a single file library except its nicer to maintain split into modules. The overall design depends pretty heavily on inlining, and none of the internal symbols are exported at all. Exposing the internals directly would be contrary to the design principle of only providing safe, supported, \"complete cryptosystem\" interfaces as much as possible.\r\n\r\nBut another library could share most of this inlining, and I disagree that exposing (say) _secp256k1_internal_* symbols would break the design, if it came to that.\r\n\r\nWRT deprecating things, it generally implies a pending removal (and timeline here should probably be >= 24 months).  I wouldn't start a deprecation unless there's a clear, documented path to removal.  Sometimes it's better to simply label \"/*  THIS IS A NASTY FUNCTION, HERE FOR LEGACY USE CASES.  Please use xxx instead and make all of our lives better */\".",
