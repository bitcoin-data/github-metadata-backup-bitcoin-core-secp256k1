This means (at least) two contexts. Passing an existing secp256k1 context to libbitcoin_consensus would leak implementation details.\nAlso it is not clear whether the libbitcoin_consensus contexts may be shared between threads. If not, this is 1.3MB per thread. If they can, this needs to be documented well as it is bound to cause confusion.\nHence I much prefer stateless, context-less functions.\n",

This totally avoids the problem of context initialization.\n\nI am not sure it is worth trying to reduce the temporary RAM usage, because the devices where that is the problem generally also have memory-mapped Flash.\n",

Of course, the smaller we can make it, the better.\n\nI imagine you would run a utility on your computer that uses libsecp256k1 to generate a (randomized?) context for signing, and then it would save it in the form of C code which can be compiled by the cross-compiler for the microcontroller.\n",

          "body": "This pull request gives an option to reduce the precomputed table size for the signing context (`ctx`) by setting `#define ECMULT_GEN_PREC_BITS [N_BITS]`.\n\nMotivation: Per #251 and #254, the static table can be reduced to 64kB. However, this is still too big for some of my embedded applications. Setting `#define ECMULT_GEN_PREC_BITS 2` produces a 32kB table at a tradeoff of about 75% of the signing speed. Not defining this value will default to the existing implementation of 4 bits. Statistics:\n\n```\nECMULT_GEN_PREC_BITS = 1\nPrecomputed table size: 32kB\n./bench_sign \necdsa_sign: min 195us / avg 200us / max 212us\n\nECMULT_GEN_PREC_BITS = 2\nPrecomputed table size: 32kB\n./bench_sign \necdsa_sign: min 119us / avg 126us / max 134us\n\nECMULT_GEN_PREC_BITS = 4 (default)\nPrecomputed table size: 64kB\n./bench_sign\necdsa_sign: min 83.5us / avg 89.6us / max 95.3us\n\nECMULT_GEN_PREC_BITS = 8\nPrecomputed table size: 512kB\n./bench_sign \necdsa_sign: min 96.4us / avg 99.4us / max 104us\n```\n\nOnly values of 2 and 4 make sense. 8 bits causes a larger table size with no increase in speed. 1 bit runs, actually, but does not reduce table size and is slower than 2 bits.\n",
