      "description": "Motivation: libsecp is already widely used today, but often in a terribly outdated version. It's likely that a release process would help with that. Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",
