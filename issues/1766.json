    "body": "The following comment:https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/7a2fff85e8729719f384a094123b965f45ae94db/src/ecmult_impl.h#L33-L41\nappears quite confusing to me, as it refers to `WINDOW_G`, while residing in the code that sets `WINDOW_A`.\n\nThis comment became lingering and out of context since commit 6815761cf5500f1a619965c5b4bbc8918b334a35.\n\nRemoving it seems reasonable, as its content is already covered by the `--with-ecmult-window` configuration option [help string](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/7a2fff85e8729719f384a094123b965f45ae94db/configure.ac#L211-L212). However, this would overlook its [original purpose](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/596) to document the `ECMULT_WINDOW_SIZE` definition when our build system is not used.",
