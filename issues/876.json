      "body": "@sipa I'm not sure how you came to your conclusion:\r\n\r\n> 7.1.4.1  If an argument to a function has an invalid value (such as a value outside the domain of the function, or a pointer outside the address space of the program, or a null pointer, or a pointer to non-modifiable storage when the corresponding parameter is not const-qualified) or a type (after promotion) not expected by a function with variable number of arguments, the behavior is undefined. If a function argument is described as being an array, the pointer actually passed to the function shall have a value such that all address computations and accesses to objects (that would be valid if the pointer did point to the first element of such an array) are in fact valid.\r\n\r\n> 7.24.1  but in all cases a char*or void*argument points to the initial (lowest addressed) character of the array. If an array is accessed beyond the end of an object, the behavior is undefined.\r\n\r\nThe pointer being passed here is both a valid value, and all address computations and accesses to objects (of which there are none) are valid.\r\n\r\nBy my reading, there is nothing wrong with the code.  That said, while don't think there is a need to change anything here, I'm not going to oppose anything.",
