    "body": "The group law in `secp256k1_gej_add_ge` is uniform, i.e., it works for P + Q no matter if P != Q or P = Q. (It still needs to handle infinity and has another special case.) \r\n\r\nIt needs 7 fe mul and 5 fe sqr, the best non-uniform group law in EFD needs one fewer sqr (https://www.hyperelliptic.org/EFD/g1p/auto-shortw-jacobian-0.html#addition-madd-2007-bl). Mabye it's faster also in practice. We could simply implement it and benchmark it.\r\n\r\nDepending on the specifics of our ecmult_gen algorithm, it may be the case that this algorithm never adds P + Q with P = Q (for example, the ecmult algorithm within the MuSig-DN circuit has a similar property)). Then, we could get away with the non-uniform law in ecmult_gen.\r\n\r\nI think we shouldn't really think about this before https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/693 has been done.",

      "body": "Doubtless it will be faster. The most obvious use-case to me is for precomputed tables of small multiples.\r\n\r\nBack in the long-long-ago I PR'd some CoZ formulae for precomputed tables (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/41 - LOL at \"That's the GMP inversion[...]; it will be hard to match it's performance.\") and I will be looking to resurrect that as a private implementation for a separated out \"precomp_table\" (or some such) module.\r\n\r\nHowever @sipa also noted there \"I don't like relying on relatively complex reasoning to show that a code path shouldn't be reachable, even if it just contains an assert\" and that was in relation to this issue of assuming P != +/-Q.\r\n\r\n#1032 is an attempt to begin putting in place some VERIFY metadata for group elements. I think proposals that rely on, shall we say, \"non-local reasoning\" for correctness would ideally be accompanied by a plan for using VERIFY metadata to validate that reasoning.\r\n\r\nOne example is \"small multiples reasoning\". The metadata could hold e.g. an actual ge_storage value of the original point (or some other unique identifier for the overall \"operation\"), and an int indicating the current multiple (or e.g 0 if it's not participating in such a scheme). Then any methods operating on these points can have suitable checks.\r\n\r\nI think another example of the kind of reasoning people sometimes use is \"odd OR even multiple of P, not exceeding half the order\", and then non-uniform additions of \"odd\" points might be used for a ladder as long as there is an intervening double between them, with maybe one or two uniform additions at the end when \"half the order\" becomes a problem.\r\n\r\nThat last example is one where you'd need to be very careful in the presence of the endomorphism, but we could probably just say \"Beware the endomorphism\" in general here. Also notably some kinds of blinding generally don't play well with non-uniform formulae.",

      "body": "I spent some time thinking about using non-uniform addition (which I assume means a rule that cannot handle doubling or cancellation correctly) in combination with signed-digit multicomb, because there seems a natural overlap: in *every* step SDMC adds a nonzero point, with a multiple of G that whose scalar has new bits set.\n\nTurns out, it is not that simple (I simulated it in Python for a small group), but it is close. I suspect that for almost all SDMC configurations, only the very last point addition can result in doubling or cancelling. I think this can be proven, but doing so generically for any configuration may be nontrivial. Perhaps we'll need some whitelisted precomputed configurations for which this is proven to hold.\n\nA downside of this approach is that it cannot start with a blinded starting point, as obviously nothing can be guaranteed about intermediary results when starting from a fully random point. So if blinding is done on the scalar, it should be counteracted by an additional (uniform) point addition at the very end. That's not actually an extra cost, if the starting point can be made infinity (so the first table lookup is just a fetch rather than an add).",

The zero/nonzeroness is statically known, while the sign depends on the actual scalar. A cancellation/doubling occurs when the intermediary value is +- equal to the table entry being added. You can statically reason about every table entry, and trying to match it +- to signs of the existing pattern so far. If that's not possible for every table entry, you know doubling/cancelling cannot occur.\r\n\r\nEven if you were to do a reduction mod N on the sign-recoded scalar (guaranteeing only 256 d values), you may get collisions between the existing pattern and what is being added, because the 0s in the pattern count as 1/2 in the signed recoding, and (1/2 mod N) isn't a perfectly nice number.",

      "body": "@peterdettman I'm not convinced, because the pattern of zero/nonzero bits differs between the intermediary value and the table entry being added, and the difference between these patterns translates to less nice patterns when \"projected\" onto pure 1,-1 values. I think it is indeed the case that you don't hit collisions until you've added almost all bits, but I believe this is mostly due to information theoretical reasons (the table entries are drawn from a small sets, the intermediary values are a small fraction of the total space until the very end, collisions are just very rare).",

Assuming my code is right, of course.

      "body": "@real-or-random I'm sure I've seen this paper before, and I would have thought it was already discussed (perhaps @gmaxwell brought it to our attention?), but am not sure. Anyway, some notes to curb the enthusiasm a little:\r\n\r\n- Requires a separate homogeneous coordinates group element. Not a problem per se, just add `secp256k1_geh` and go from there, but will be extra code and probably will need, besides geh-specific formulae, several conversion methods.\r\n- Relevant to _batch_ verification; single-signature verification (Strauss) uses `_gej_add_ge_var`. This is also I think why the paper didn't make a splash here in 2016, since the `ecmult_multi` stuff is relatively recent.\r\n- Incurs an expensive doubling formula, which will offset potential gains from faster addition. In some scenarios doubling is only a minority of operations and it may work out. For a run of say 4 or 5 doublings it _might_ be possible to sidestep into jacobian coordinates and back to mitigate the damage.\r\n- Formulae use the curve `b` coordinate; this doesn't play well with our isomorphism (effective-affine) tricks. It's not insurmountable mathematically, but those \"mul by small multiple of b\" counts would at least become full field multiplications if b' -> b.Z^6 for some arbitrary Z.\r\n\r\nHaven't (re-)read in detail yet, so it's quite possible there's still gold there that I haven't noticed. I think it would still be informative to put together a branch where we add secp256k1_geh and try to use it in the `ecmult_multi ` stuff, or wherever seems most promising to people.",

But in this case it could be beneficial if we compute the doublings in jacobian coordinates (a bunch of doublings) and then do the main part  in homogeneous coordinates (additions). See also Remark 3 (p. 16) in the paper. (edit: Hmmm, maybe we'd need to keep the buckets in homogeneous coordinates too.... It's not clear right now to me, we will need to try.)\r\n\r\n> Formulae use the curve b coordinate; this doesn't play well with our isomorphism (effective-affine) tricks. It's not insurmountable mathematically, but those \"mul by small multiple of b\" counts would at least become full field multiplications if b' -> b.Z^6 for some arbitrary Z.\r\n\r\nRight, but we use the tricks only for in Strauss' algorithm.

I'm not quite clear on how the 32 blocks/8 teeth thing has so many danger points, but my mind is kind of on other stuff at the moment.\r\n\r\nDo we see any way that the endomorphism can be useful in signing? I see at least that you could split the scalar and use half the blocks e.g. 2B * 5T * 13S to cover 130 bits (unfortunately this probably needs skew-handling like ecdh). This gains nothing if you need 2 separate sets of tables anyway, but it halves memory usage if you construct the endo-points on-the-fly instead of the second set of tables (in this 2/5/13 config that's an extra 26 field muls). Probably that doesn't gain much given that you can probably just tweak the SDMC config to use less memory at a similar performance cost anyway. I guess if a given config has lots of doublings (big spacing), then half-ish of them could be saved instead. Anything else?\r\n",

But in this case it could be beneficial if we compute the doublings in jacobian coordinates (a bunch of doublings) and then do the main part in homogeneous coordinates (additions). See also Remark 3 (p. 16) in the paper. (edit: Hmmm, maybe we'd need to keep the buckets in homogeneous coordinates too.... It's not clear right now to me, we will need to try.)\r\n\r\nFwiw, I sketched a modified variant of Pippenger's algorithm that uses homogeneous coordinates in the main loop (without actually implementing the group law):\r\nhttps://github.com/real-or-random/secp256k1/commit/dddbf8129f23b434157446b5a4c2f3d2636e8fc5 \r\n\r\nI think it's promising...",

      "body": "I believe that our current `ecmult_const` algorithm cannot trigger doubling or cancellation in the first 63 iterations of the ladder (out of 64).\r\n\r\nDuring the algorithm, the scalar $a$ is converted into $x + \\lambda y$, where $(x,y) \\in [1-2^{128},2^{128}-1]^2$. Those $x$ and $y$ are then written in wNAF-like signed-digit form:\r\n\r\n$$x = \\sum_{i=0}^{63} x_i 2^{4i} \\textrm{, where } x_i \\in \\\\{-15,-13,\\ldots,15\\\\}$$\r\n\r\nAnd analogously for $y$ (which possibly needs an offset of $1$, or $\\lambda$, or both, which will be corrected after the algorithm loop, and isn't relevant here).\r\n\r\nThe algorithm for computing $a\\cdot P$ then proceeds as:\r\n* Start with result point $R = 0$.\r\n* For $i = 0 \\ldots 63$:\r\n   * $R \\leftarrow 2^4 R \\quad$ (no-op at $i=0$).\r\n   * $R \\leftarrow R + x_{63-i} P$.\r\n   * $R \\leftarrow R + y_{63-i} \\lambda P$.\r\n \r\nIt's easy to see that the result of both point additions in the loop above is of the form $(a + \\lambda b) P$, where $(a,b) \\in [1-2^{4(i+1)},2^{4(i+1)}-1]^2 \\setminus \\\\{(0,0)\\\\}$.\r\n\r\nUp to $i=62$, no such $(a,b)$ exists for which $a + \\lambda b = 0\\\\ (mod\\\\ n)$. That means that neither of the two point addition can result in cancellation. By observing that the $x_{63-i}$ or $y_{63-i}$ could be be negated, and knowing that no $R + x_{63-i}P = 0$, we also know that $R + (-x_{63-i}P) = 0$ is impossible, meaning doubling is impossible.\r\n\r\nTo show that no non-zero $(a,b)$ in $[1-2^{124},2^{124}-1]$ exists for which $a + \\lambda b = 0\\\\ (mod\\\\ n)$ exists, observe that the solutions to $(a,b)$ form a lattice, spanned by $(n,0)$, $(0,n)$, and $(\\lambda, -1)$. The minimal vector in that lattice under the $\\\\|\\cdot\\\\|_\\infty$ norm is $(0x3086d221a7d46bcde86c90e49284eb15, -0xe4437ed6010e88286f547fa90abfe4c3)$.\r\n",
