    "title": "(RFC) Add code coverage support for CMake",
    "body": "Opening this to solicit feedback. Currently, its only possible to generate a coverage report by using the `make / autoconf` build system. Ideally, the developer can use either CMake or make and be able to generate coverage reports. I haven't spent much time researching how to do this with CMake, but some quick googling seems to indicate that it is at least possible, e.g., https://danielsieger.com/blog/2024/08/03/code-coverage-with-cmake.html.\n\nI'll update this issue periodically as I come back to this, but also interested to hear if others think this is worth it or have recommendations on the approach.\n\ncc @hebasto ",
