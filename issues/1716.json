    "title": "(RFC) Add code coverage support for CMake",
    "body": "Opening this to solicit feedback. Currently, its only possible to generate a coverage report by using the `make / autoconf` build system. Ideally, the developer can use either CMake or make and be able to generate coverage reports. I haven't spent much time researching how to do this with CMake, but some quick googling seems to indicate that it is at least possible, e.g., https://danielsieger.com/blog/2024/08/03/code-coverage-with-cmake.html.\n\nI'll update this issue periodically as I come back to this, but also interested to hear if others think this is worth it or have recommendations on the approach.\n\ncc @hebasto ",

      "body": "> Let's see if we can pick up the work again. :)\n\nThere are many code coverage implementations, and two of them are most notable.\n\n**First** one is based on the [`gcov`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) tool. The basic guidance is to compile without optimization, i.e., with `-O0`. n CMake, the general approach is to encapsulate optimisation- and debug-level flags into an abstraction called a build/configuration type. This ensures there are no conflicts between flags specifying different optimisation levels, and works particularly well with multi-config generators. In [Professional CMake: A Practical Guide 21st Edition](https://discourse.cmake.org/t/professional-cmake-a-practical-guide-21st-edition/14127), section 33.2. Code Coverage, the author suggests the same approach.\n\nThere is a caveat specific to the libsecp256k1 code: when `VERIFY` is defined, it makes the resulting coverage reports meaningless. Therefore, the `tests` executable should not be built instrumented for coverage analysis at all. This is not a trivial task with CMake's multi-config generators. https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1592 addressed this issue, given that in practice coverage reports using GCC + `gcov` could be limited to the “Ninja Multi-Config” generator.\n\n**Second** is [Clang Source-based Coverage](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html), which claims that:\n> llvm optimizations (such as inlining or CFG simplification) should have no impact on coverage report quality.\n\nThis is not documented in this project.\n\n**A Note from Bitcoin Core**. Historically, Bitcoin Core used the first method. Recently, many developers [have been leaning](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31933) towards the second.\n\n> [@hebasto](https://github.com/hebasto) I think the last real activity was [me asking why #1592 is better than #1291](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1592#issuecomment-2296781598).\n\nWhen using the `SECP256K1_COVERAGE` configuration option with multi-config generators, we have to deal with optimization-level flags in already defined build types. We could either (1) overwrite configuration-specific flags for every configuration, which is widely agreed to be poor practice, or (2) specify an additional non-defined build type, e.g., `NONE`, to nullify them, which is awkward.\n\n> It's probably also worth taking a look at the blog post mentioned by josie. It just builds a separate test binary for coverage. Perhaps this is the simple solution we've been overlooking all the time? This approach gets rid of the need to perform the entire build in a special coverage \"mode\" (however this is implemented). You could just build the coverage tests along with all normal tests. The same should work with autotools.\n\nAt present, two test executables generate data for coverage analysis: `tests` and `exhaustive_tests`.\n",
