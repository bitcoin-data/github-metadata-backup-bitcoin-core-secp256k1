    "body": "Greetings secp256k1 developers and contributors,\r\n\r\nWe’re reaching out because your project is an important part of the open source ecosystem, and we’d like to invite you to integrate with our [fuzzing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fuzzing) service, [OSS-Fuzz]( https://opensource.googleblog.com/2016/12/announcing-oss-fuzz-continuous-fuzzing.html ). OSS-Fuzz is a free fuzzing infrastructure you can use to identify security vulnerabilities and stability bugs in your project. OSS-Fuzz will:\r\n\r\n- Continuously run at scale all the fuzzers you write.\r\n- Alert you when it finds issues.\r\n- Automatically close issues after they’ve been fixed by a commit.\r\n\r\nMany widely used [open source projects]( https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects ) like OpenSSL, FFmpeg, LibreOffice, and ImageMagick are fuzzing via OSS-Fuzz, which helps them find and remediate [critical issues]( https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?can=1&q=status%3AFixed%2CVerified+Type%3ABug%2CBug-Security+-component%3AInfra+ ). \r\n\r\nEven though typical integrations can be done in < 100 LoC, we have a [reward program]( https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/patch-rewards/ ) in place which aims to recognize folks who are not just contributing to open source, but are also working hard to make it more secure.\r\n\r\nWe want to stress that anyone who meets the eligibility criteria and integrates a project with OSS-Fuzz is eligible for a reward.\r\n\r\nIf you're not interested in integrating with OSS-Fuzz, it would be helpful for us to understand why—lack of interest, lack of time, or something else—so we can better support projects like yours in the future.\r\n\r\nIf we’ve missed your question in our [FAQ]( https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/faq/ ), feel free to reply or reach out to us at oss-fuzz-outreach@googlegroups.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nTommy\r\nOSS-Fuzz Team\r\n",

I think the type of continous fuzzing you are suggesting is a great opportunity to avoid shipping *newly introduced issues* (I think we are covered with regards to existing code). Thanks!\r\n\r\nVery strong concept ACK\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell \r\n\r\n> IIRC Bitcoin previously didn't participate with this google program because there was some extremely short timeframe mandatory disclosure which basically made anything except blindly installed automatic updates a viable way to deploy fixes.\r\n\r\nSome counter-arguments:\r\n- 1.) Continuous fuzzing as suggested by the OP will likely uncover only *newly introduced issues in non-deployed code* as opposed to *existing issues in already deployed code*: if we think that just throwing computing resources at _existing_ fuzzers will uncover critical security issues in already deployed code then we have much bigger problems than a 90 day disclosure deadline :)\r\n- 2.) Black hats are fuzzing 24/7 regardless of what we choose to do. Not using OSS-Fuzz is essentially giving black hats an advantage. I don't think that is in the best interest of our users.\r\n- 3.) The whole \"we are worse off with OSS-Fuzz than without it\" argument breaks down if one person at some point in time decides to setup his/her own ClusterFuzz instance and decides to publish any results immediately or after `90-n` days -- we are supposed to be trust-minimizing :)\r\n\r\nPersonally I'm convinced that our users are much better off with continuous fuzzing using OSS-Fuzz than without it :)",

      "body": "Thanks for reaching out, @Google-Autofuzz.\r\n\r\nLet me offer some historical perspective here.\r\n\r\nBy its nature, Bitcoin's rules are effectively defined by the software that users choose to run. As no authority exists that can compel anyone to upgrade, some classes of code issues effectively are not bugs, but for better or worse the rules of the network. If two implementations differ, sometimes in a tiny detail, this may be exploitable to split the network in two.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary requirement for exact consistency between implementations means that these classes of issues cannot be fixed in the time scale of software releases, but requires network-wide coordination. The most relevant example is how a platform dependent deviation from the DER standard in OpenSSL threatened a network split a few years ago; you can read about the issue and its timeline [here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-July/009697.html). In that case, it took 9 months between discovery and eventual resolution, but I believe that similar issues these days would take significantly longer still.\r\n\r\nI hope you see why the OSS-Fuzz timeline of disclosure in 90 days (+ 14 days if fixed) would not be appropriate for such issues, and thus would be hard for us to agree to.\r\n\r\nThat said, I am excited about fuzzing based testing, in this library, and in open source in general, and happy for the work that you guys are doing to promote that. As far as libsecp256k1 is concerned:\r\n* We already have done extensive coverage-based testing in the past (thanks to @gmaxwell); a minimized set of inputs that came out of that is in fact part of the unit tests (see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/f862b4ca13ffb616e0738839bf48b26caca32387/src/tests.c#L1123L1670)\r\n* I've recently played around with libFuzzer and would like to see automated fuzzing integrated into this library. Arguably, until that's done, the discussion here is kind of moot.\r\n* Once that's done, we can likely get 100s of CPU cores for automated tested from companies contributing to the project. I'm more comfortable using those, as they come without scary disclosure timelines.",

      "body": "- Cryptofuzz currently only supports private to public conversion, ECDSA Sign, ECDSA Verify and ECDH derive. There is currently no support for binary encodings of keys/points. Rather, it consumes strings of numbers (bigints). If these features are sufficient I will be happy to implement it. Otherwise take a look at https://github.com/catenacyber/elliptic-curve-differential-fuzzer CC @catenacyber\r\n- Consider converting your static test vectors to the format that the ECC differential fuzzer consumes. Even if you choose not to engage with OSS-Fuzz, this might be useful as a one-off or periodical test due to 1) comparing results to other libraries 2) piggy-backing off the corpus that the ECC diff fuzzer has produced. You can build and run all OSS-Fuzz projects locally.\r\n- If you are willing to implement support for it, you can use Cryptofuzz to find more BER/DER parsing discrepancies. It has support for a lot of libraries and you can use the OSS-Fuzz project to build them all and run it locally. Since the project is specifically aimed at finding discrepancies in crypto libraries, this might be an easier solution than building a differential BER parsing fuzzer for from scratch.",

While the core of this library is very well tested, other parts are evolving and have not been extensively fuzz-tested so far.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a consensus issue (see sipa's post above) there is only a small difference between a malicious actor with 0 days \"disclosure\" and a 90 days disclosure deadline. Would it be possible to get an exception for the Bitcoin Core project? A general disclosure deadline on the order of 15 months would be more responsible. I can not support efforts committed to disclosure policies that are irresponsible to Bitcoin Core users. This does not necessarily mean that there's an increased risk of 0-days because stakeholders in the Bitcoin ecosystem may contribute their computational resources once we have good fuzz testing harnesses.\r\n\r\n> Can you point to such a somewhat hostile response from the OSS-Fuzz people?\r\n\r\nI did not find any discussion on the topic besides the two links Marco posted, nor previous interactions with OSS-Fuzz.\r\n",

That is consensus building the academic way at its finest (as opposed to \"effective\" corporate style top-down decision making where it might matter *who* says something instead of only *what* is said, and where underlings voicing counter-arguments is sometimes weirdly seen as attempts to \"insult\" those in power).\r\n\r\n@Google-Autofuzz \r\n\r\nYesterday the question was raised on IRC about what computing resources a project like `libsecp256k1` or Bitcoin Core would get if integrated with OSS-Fuzz:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<BlueMatt> i mean how many cpu hours does oss-fuzz provide? I cant imagine it is anything significantly more than the 100 cores/project full-time that we already have?\r\n…\r\n<sipa> if it's indeed not (significantly more than) 100 cores, there isn't much to be gained from using it\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor us to better understand the trade-offs we're facing here, could you please clarify? :)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFull context from `#bitcoin-core-dev`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<elichai2> ariard  told me there is past interaction with oss-fuzz and it was decided that the disclosure policy doesn't fit Core, is that right? I'm interested to hear about it :)\r\n<sipa> ping BlueMatt\r\n<sipa> though if i remember correctly, at the time there also was no (meaningful) fuzzers for bitcoin core, so it was mostly a philosophical point\r\n<BlueMatt> elichai2: yea, oss-fuzz has some rather-strict rules about how they will disclose issues publicly after N days of reporting them.\r\n<BlueMatt> elichai2: at the time, and imo quite reasonably, we decided that was completely unacceptable for a p2p consensus system which may, depending on the type of failure, require network-wide update for something to be safe, and some rapid disclosure policy is not compatible with that\r\n<BlueMatt> elichai2: also note that oss-fuzz primarily just provides cpu hours, it doesn't do any actual implementation work for you, and getting access to a few hundred cores for bitcoin core fuzzing is rather easy :p\r\n<sipa> BlueMatt: on the other hand, we currently have fuzzers for the codebase (yay), and we can't prevent anyone from running them secretly on a massive cluster\r\n<BlueMatt> (as a reminder: lots of cpu cores are available in a few locations for those doing bitcoin open source work)\r\n<BlueMatt> sipa: sadly they're mostly all kinda boring targets :(\r\n<BlueMatt> but we *have* a few rather reasonably-sized clusters in various places...\r\n<sipa> BlueMatt: have you paid attention to the more recently added ones?\r\n<BlueMatt> dont think any are currently fuzzing core, but...\r\n<BlueMatt> ah, marco's fuzz stuff got merged! I missed that.\r\n<sipa> so perhaps... either we keep the more delicate ones private (how?), or we're ok with having the ones we have publicly participate in oss-fuzz?\r\n<BlueMatt> well, someone should give them more cpu hours. afair marco had previously done stuff, but...\r\n<sipa> of course - we can also just increase how much cpu we spend ourselves\r\n<BlueMatt> or we could, you know, use the cluster(s) we have to get fuzz hours :)\r\n<sipa> well, or both\r\n<BlueMatt> there's probably at least 120 cpu cores lying around for such usage, just need someone to step up and write scripts\r\n<BlueMatt> i mean how many cpu hours does oss-fuzz provide? I cant imagine it is anything significantly more than the 100 cores/project full-time that we already have?\r\n<BlueMatt> and the tradeoffs for using it...kinda suck\r\n<sipa> that's a great question\r\n<BlueMatt> we could also ask osuosl if heir CI cluster has free cores: https://osuosl.org/services/hosting/details/\r\n<sipa> if it's indeed not (significantly more than) 100 cores, there isn't much to be gained from using it\r\n<BlueMatt> a few bitcoin groups gave them some funds afaiu\r\n<BlueMatt> but, you know, we should probably use our own cpus first.\r\n<BlueMatt> anyway, really just need someone to step up and manage VMs that run fuzzing. I can help a bit, I have it all set up for rust-lightning and regularly pull ~100 cores for that, but I dont really have the bandwidth to manage that all the time, let alone also for core.\r\n<BlueMatt> someone just let me or dongcarl know and we can get you set up with a few VMs with a bunch of cores, I presume there's soeone at blockstream who can do the same\r\n<elichai2> BlueMatt: are these bare metal? because running something like this to detect improvements/regressions can be very helpful: https://perf.rust-lang.org/\r\n<BlueMatt> kvm, but there are separate bare-metal servers intended for benchmarking cc jamesob\r\n<BlueMatt> (which are slower, but bare-metal and more 'average-grade' hardware)\r\n<elichai2> yeah but sadly you need bare metal for profiling, VMs are too dynamic for that AFAIK\r\n<BlueMatt> right, kvm just for non-benchmark things\r\n<BlueMatt> we have ~9 servers which are provisioned bare-metal for benchmarking\r\n<BlueMatt> 9 being 8-outbound-1-target for ibd benchmarking :)\r\n<BlueMatt> though you'd have to ask james as to the status of those\r\n<elichai2> I have my own PC dedicated for profiling benchmarking, trying different system wide changes to Bitcoin Core\r\n<BlueMatt> anyway, hardware/cpu resources isnt the issue, just gotta have someone write bash scripts :)\r\n<BlueMatt> well, and babysit to watch for errors\r\n<elichai2> BlueMatt: from what I looked in oss-fuzz it looks really simple, You write a simple dockerfile to compile and run and that's about it https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/libsodium/Dockerfile\r\n<BlueMatt> well by the time you've done that much work you might as well run it on our own hardware (without the aggressive public-disclosure timelines that may put bitcoin users at risk...)\r\n<elichai2> and if I understand correctly Google will actually pay you if you integrate into oss-fuzz https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/739 \"We want to stress that anyone who meets the eligibility criteria and integrates a project with OSS-Fuzz is eligible for a reward.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
