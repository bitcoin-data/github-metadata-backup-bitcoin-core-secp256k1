    "body": "If the library itself is compiled without -DSECP256K1_BUILD then it will be (minorly) miscompiled:  all the nullness checks on the interfaces which specify that their arguments be non-null will get optimized out (the exported symbols also won't get flagged for windows, but presumably where that matters it'll get noticed).\r\n\r\nIs there any reason to not just have secp256k1.c #define SECP256K1_BUILD before including any headers and then drop any requirement for the build system?\r\n\r\nIf that can't be done, it should probably check and #error if it isn't defined.  But making it configuration-free seems much better to me.",

I think this would be pretty fool-proof.  If there is some reason that can't be done secp256k1.c compile could fail if SECP256K1_BUILD isn't set.  I prefer the foolproof way because demanding the build system set some define is more trouble for users that aren't using the build system.\r\n\r\nRelated, USE_FIELD_INV_BUILTIN/USE_SCALAR_INV_BUILTIN should get automatically defaulted.  (maybe these go away with safegcd?)  right now a non-buildsystem user needs to set them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps for the rest too... I think now that there aren't defines needed for the fe/scalar type it should be possible to build with zero defines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
