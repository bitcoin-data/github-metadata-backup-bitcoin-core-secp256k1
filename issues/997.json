    "body": "I think we should have a documented policy on the scope of the library. The discussion comes up from time to time [0] and has never really been resolved, I think.  We don't strictly need answers to these questions but I feel a written policy would avoid some discussions and bikeshedding in the future. And of course, a policy won't be written in stone, we can still change it if have a reason to do so.\r\n\r\nOne way to approach this is \"features that are used by Bitcoin Core now or a have a good chance to be used by Bitcoin Core in the future\". ECDH was somewhat of an exception here but maybe it will be used in the future for BIP324 (P2P encryption).\r\n\r\nAnother approach is to add features that are useful to the wider ecosystem. Of course, this does not mean that we need to accept every feature that meets this definition --- including features means that we commit on maintaining them.\r\n\r\nI think with ECDH and Java bindings, the thinking here was more towards the latter approach. Personally I lean more towards the former idea because it avoids the need to take decisions about what to include, and it saves resources. (For example, Java bindings have been removed for a reason.)\r\n\r\nA somewhat related discussion is the one about experimental features (#817). For example, if we view musig2 as something that can be experimented around with in a fork such as secp256k1-zkp but then plan on porting it to here [0], then what's the difference to something which can go in as an experimental module? Is musig2 \"super-experimental\", is it just not clear yet if it has a good chance of ending up in Bitcoin Core or is there just really no difference in the end?\r\n\r\nRight now, I think there's a good chance that #995 will be merged, so if we wanted to deprecate experimental modules (as has been proposed in #817 but couldn't find consensus), now would be a good time.\r\n\r\n[0] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23326#issuecomment-947942068  \r\n",

That is also in the best interest of Core.\r\n\r\nI don't see anything fundamentally wrong with people using libsecp-zkp if they want additional features, since -zkp is just libsecp with additional modules.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps that doesn't matter too much because it's hard to find an example for something that is widely used in Bitcoin but not in Core. At least for the MuSig example (ignoring https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2332) it would be difficult to imagine that it's widely used in the Bitcoin ecosystem but not in Core (perhaps there could be the case where it's used only in the Lightning ecosystem).",

      "body": "> Hmm, my view would be that libsecp256k1-zkp exists to serve the Elements ecosystem, and libsecp256k1 exists to serve the Bitcoin ecosystem. \r\n\r\nThat's a good point, and maybe that's the right view to see it. It's just not what's done in practice. -zkp started for the Elements ecosystem but now it's used as a place to get your Bitcoin schemes merged because (i) it's easier to get things merged there (is it?), and (ii) people may assume that our policy is to accept Core-only features (@jonasnick  used exactly this reasoning above for musig! [1]) This again shows we should have a documented policy.\r\n\r\nThe two examples are ECDSA adaptor sigs and ECDSA sign-to-contract including anti-exfil signing with HW wallets. At least the latter thing is certainly relevant to Core as well. \r\n\r\nOf course you could have those in another third fork secp256k1-beyondcore (with a better name obviously) but this would it even harder for users who want features from all three repos then, e.g., hardware wallets. It may be possible to solve this with a proper module system but this introduces a bunch of other problems. (Nevertheless I think we should support every change here that makes it easier for others to implement more modules in their repos.)\r\n\r\n[1] The story with MuSig may be a little bit more involved. I assume with MuSig2 there's more demand in Core than there was with MuSig1, and given that MuSig1 is -zkp already, it made sense to PR MuSig2 there.  ",

          "body": "Is anyone working on, or considering adding VRF support to secp256k1-zkp?\r\n\r\nThere is a fork of libsecp at https://github.com/aergoio/secp256k1-vrf that implements it. (/cc by @aergoio @kroggen)\r\n\r\nfrom: [README.md#verifiable-random-function-vrf](https://github.com/aergoio/secp256k1-vrf/blob/master/README.md#verifiable-random-function-vrf):\r\n> This library has an implementation of an ECVRF based on the [IETF draft 05](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05.html) using the secp256k1 curve, SHA256 as hash function and try-and-increment as hash to curve method (cipher suite SECP256K1_SHA256_TAI). The cipher suite code used is 0xFE for compatibility with other implementations.\r\n>\r\n> It was implemented as a fork because the parent library does not export the required functions.\r\n\r\nThere are many interesting use case for VRFs ([Verifiable Random Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_random_function) [[original paper]](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/5028196/Vadhan_VerifRandomFunction.pdf)), but for our @BlockchainCommons roadmap, we would like to see use it in a similar way that [CONIKS](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity15/technical-sessions/presentation/melara) [[pdf]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/1004.pdf), [Key Transparency](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/01/security-through-transparency.html) [[design doc]](https://github.com/google/keytransparency/blob/master/docs/design.md) [[slides]](http://sconce.ics.uci.edu/203-W17/Security%20Through%20Transparency%20-%20UCI.pdf) & [Kademilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia) [[paper]](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf) use them for private commitments. We can't use Schnorr signatures as they are do not guarantee uniqueness of the signature because of the random nonce requirements _(sidenote: @sipa does Musig-DN qualify as a VRF?)_.\r\n\r\nOther uses for VRFs are: random oracles, non-interactive lottery systems, updatable zero-knowledge databases, Resettable zero-knowledge proofs, L2 e-cash, rotatable Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and more.\r\n\r\nOur challenge is that we also want to support MUSIG2 now and FROST when it gets finished here, but likely before they will likely be merged into the upstream master. We don't want to have to support 2 forks of the secp256k1 upstream master, so would really like to see VRFs in THIS fork. We don't want to support [draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-11](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-11) because it is 25519, not curve secp256k1.\r\n\r\n/cc @jesseposner @wolfmcnally @kanzure @maaku\r\n\r\nSome other related links:\r\n* [What is the difference between signatures and VRF? | Stack-Exchange Cryptography](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/50683)\r\n* [CONIKS vs Key Transparency vs Certificate Transparency vs Blockchains | okTurtles Blog](https://blog.okturtles.org/2017/02/coniks-vs-key-transparency-vs-certificate-transparency-vs-blockchains/)\r\n",

          "body": "There is a need for a reasonable long-term \"staging\" ground branch for sep256k1 related crypto that might ultimately be brought into the bitcoin ecosystem, not just at the L1 level but also at L2.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that Bitcoin Core's [secp256k1 library](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/) tends to not merge branches until they are extremely mature and are ready to use in an upcoming L1 release.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, Blockstream's Elements [secp256k1-zkp] has unofficially served this purpose, with early versions of Segwit, Schnorr, Taproot, etc. being first implemented there first and ultimately merged into the upstream master. Most recently, Musig 2 has been implemented in Elements -zkp branch and is under evaluation for merging upstream, and work toward quorum threshold FROST has started on Elements -zkp.\r\n\r\nHowever, Blockstream and the Elements team are not sure that their Elements -zkp branch should be used this way, unless it is specifically for a Blockstream project. This causes problems as there are other important cryptographic functions that need tight integration with the secp256k1 library, but are not currently important to Blockstream, that ought to be supported by the larger community. Currently having to support multiple branches of the secp256k1 library is problematic.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the right answer is to persuade Blockstream to broaden their support of other cryptographic code into Elements -zkp, or to try to build community support in the broader bitcoin-core community for an official long-term experimental staging branch hosted there, or if this is something that Blockchain Commons should try to offer the ecosystem. In the latter case, we don't have a sufficient level of cryptographic engineers to support a project like this, but we could possibly encourage some to commit to support a project like this hosted by Blockchain Commons.\r\n\r\n* Discussion about this in [Bitcoin Core issues](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/997#issuecomment-949463114]\r\n* Discussion about this topic at [Elements issues](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/issues/190)\r\n* Related:\r\n  * [Adapter Signatures for Schnorr](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/issues/191)\r\n  * [VRF for secp256k1](https://github.com/aergoio/secp256k1-vrf)\r\n\r\n/cc @kanzure @jesseposner @maaku @wolfmcnally @kanzure",

      "body": "I agree with all the above. Intuitively restricting libsecp256k1 to just what is needed in Bitcoin Core seems unnecessarily restrictive but without that restriction the line gets increasingly fuzzy.\r\n\r\ne.g. \r\n\r\n> Hmm, my view would be that libsecp256k1-zkp exists to serve the Elements ecosystem, and libsecp256k1 exists to serve the Bitcoin ecosystem. That shouldn't just mean Bitcoin Core - it's a separate library for a reason - but we should probably document to what extent Bitcoin Core has a special place (if any), e.g. its use of experimental features (if any).\r\n\r\nI always considered Liquid a subset of the Bitcoin ecosystem like I consider Lightning a subset of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Applied to the libsecp256k1/libsecp256k1-zkp scope discussion that would mean everything in libsecp256k1-zkp that is active on Liquid would eventually make its way into libsecp256k1 and then libsecp256k1-zkp effectively becomes just a staging ground for libsecp256k1. That seems unnecessarily loose to me.\r\n\r\n> But perhaps that doesn't matter too much because it's hard to find an example for something that is widely used in Bitcoin but not in Core. At least for the MuSig example (ignoring https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2332) it would be difficult to imagine that it's widely used in the Bitcoin ecosystem but not in Core (perhaps there could be the case where it's used only in the Lightning ecosystem).\r\n\r\nThe alternative to defining a clear scope is to just take it case by case. MuSig2 in Lightning provides some interesting case studies. \r\n\r\n1) MuSig2 could be used in Lightning for \"[recursive](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2022-June/003600.html)\" or nested MuSig2 which wouldn't be a Lightning protocol issue (other than supporting Schnorr signatures). Some Lightning implementations might choose to support it while others may not.\r\n\r\n2) Changing the 2-of-2 multisig that is funded by both counterparties when opening the channel to a single pubkey with MuSig2 would be a Lightning protocol issue. \r\n\r\nMy view would be that supporting the Lightning protocol in 2) would make MuSig2 a no brainer for libsecp256k1. I'm unsure on whether supporting individual Lightning implementations in 1) and not necessarily the Lightning protocol would be a strong enough argument for libsecp256k1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

          "title": "consider adding musig2 and adaptor signatures to the bitcoin::schnorr module",
          "body": "One of the most useful properties of the TapRoot upgrade - and the support for Schnorr signatures which came along with it - is the fact that we can now use simple trustless key aggregation protocols like MuSig, and powerful scriptless contract primitives like Adaptor Signatures (AKA verifiably encrypted signatures). \r\n\r\nI don't see any mention of MuSig or Adaptor Signatures in the code, issues, or PRs in this repo. I'd like to propose we add these tools, as they are very important building blocks for modern bitcoin devs.\r\n\r\nAs for the best road to this goal, I'd be happy to shamelessly shill [my own MuSig implementation](https://github.com/conduition/musig2), for which I recently [finished a draft PR adding adaptor signatures](https://github.com/conduition/musig2/pull/1). It's fully compatible with [the current draft of BIP327](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki), and doesn't pull in any significant new dependencies (it uses the `secp256k1` crate for curve math).\r\n\r\nWe could also use @LLFourn's [`schnorr_fun` crate](https://github.com/LLFourn/secp256kfun/tree/master/schnorr_fun), although this would necessitate switching to `secp256kfun` for curve math.",
