Updating the subtree to `cd470333351bd6d90296352f2a957f38bbdaf014` (merging #1084) causes Bitcoin Core CI failure as it cannot run the config scripts anymore as seen [here](https://github.com/dhruv/bitcoin-core-ci/pull/14/checks)\r\n\r\nI don't know much about build systems, but am happy to learn and help with guidance.",
