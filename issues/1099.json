      "body": "So this is about multiplication of a secret scalar with any public point, without precomputation (what we call `ecmult_const` here, used in ECDH here). The second link is the  journal/accepted version of the first paper, if I understand correctly.\r\n\r\nIt's very interesting, and apparently Mike Hamburg presented a simple variant of the ideas in [a rump talk at CHES17](https://ches.2017.rump.cr.yp.to/a1933e522beb16591d9dc8e373ad7079.pdf), which is also described in the journal version of the paper. What makes this interesting: the approach here seems to be inspired by the Montgomery ladder but it works on every short Weierstrass curve. The slides even mention that it's possible to turn it into an x-only ladder, which so far I assumed is only possible on Montgomery curves. (Related: #262 but this uses a different method to speed up x-only ECDH).\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @brandonblack\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n> Quirk: the algorithm researchers are from **North Korea** :neutral_face:\r\n \r\nWe should not judge people based on their origin or nationality but even if you disagree, we should not judge algorithms based on the origin or nationality of their inventors.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "As somewhat discussed in my PR against noble-secp256k1, these algorithms are constant time on the number of bits in the scalar. It's above my pay grade to know what modifications would correctly make them constant time on a fixed number of bits. To pass the sniff test, I ran the initialization function, the per-bit transform for each leading zero, and then the initialization again to begin computing the real output value.\r\n\r\nI experimented with a couple of the algorithms they presented (8-, and 9-register), and found that in the context of JavaScript native bigints the 8-register version performed best. Which is fastest depends on the relationship between the cost of modmul, modadd, and modsub, as the 9-register version has 2 fewer multiplications, but 2 extra subtractions and 9 extra additions per iteration.",

Over binary fields, the Montgomery scalar multiplication algorithm which was presented at the first CHES workshop by López and Dahab has been a favorite of ECC implementors, due to its nice properties such as high efficiency outperforming the binary NAF, natural SPA-resistance, generality coping with all ordinary curves and implementation easiness. Over odd characteristic fields, the new scalar multiplication algorithms are the first ones featuring all these properties. Building-blocks of our contribution are new efficient differential addition-and-doubling formulae and a novel conception of on-the-fly adaptive coordinates which softly represent points occurring during a scalar multiplication not only in accordance with the basepoint but also bits of the given scalar. Importantly, the new algorithms are equipped with built-in countermeasures against known side-channel attacks, while it is shown that previous Montgomery ladder algorithms with the randomized addressing countermeasure fail to thwart attacks exploiting address-dependent leakage.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/paulmillr/noble-secp256k1/pull/55\r\n\r\n>  This is an algorithm for EC multiplication that emulates the Montgomery\r\n    Ladder double-and-add, but in a constant time way. An early version of\r\n    this algorithm was published in 2017, and the version implemented here\r\n    was published in 2020. The result is constant time multiply that is 85%\r\n    faster than wNAF, <10% slower than endomorphic Montgommery Ladder and\r\n    ~20% faster than w/o endomorphism.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1099\r\n\r\nMay be combined with #35 ",
