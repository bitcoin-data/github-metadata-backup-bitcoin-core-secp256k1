      "description": "Motivation: libsecp is already widely used today, but often in a terribly outdated version. It's likely that a release process would help with that. Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",

I believe the default stack on Windows is 1MB,  linux kernel code stack size is 8kb,  32-bit linux default stack size is 2MB.  Lots of other systems have a modest default stack. IIRC firefox multimedia threads have a 128kb stack.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, whatever stack the library uses is added onto the caller, so it pays to be pretty conservative.\r\n\r\nThe commit message seems to indicate that valgrind was telling you that the stack was out of control. You probably don't want to ignore that-- the valgrind default setting is the amount needed for 32-bit linux to not barf, some other systems as I mention are even more constrained.\r\n\r\nFor normal usage this library shouldn't put more than a few kilobytes onto the stack. There is an issue which specifies making the stack usage explicit (#188). I suppose allowances could be made for weird configs like --disable-ecmult-static-precomputation + --with-ecmult-gen-precision=8, but even there doing well over 100kb will probably start crashing real programs on real systems.\r\n\r\nTests could probably get away with a fair bit more, since they control the entire calling stack and aren't going to cause mysterious runtime crashes-- but it would still be nice to be able to run them directly on the sort of low memory devices that can run the library.\r\n",
