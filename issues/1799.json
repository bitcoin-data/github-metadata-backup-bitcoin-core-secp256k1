    "body": "As suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1792#issuecomment-3709076530, this issue is created to discuss different scanning approaches for Silent Payments. Currently PRs for both the BIP and LabelSet approaches are open:\n* https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1765\n* https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1792\n\nA prototype implementation of the hybrid approach is available at https://github.com/w0xlt/secp256k1/commit/6c76c7c5fa30c5fa7676511de22c47953ee76bd1#diff-4d053be8d1f6d948b412f26ae89711a9dcd2a2683da581cb52b9f6757480361b\n\nSee https://gist.github.com/theStack/25c77747838610931e8bbeb9d76faf78 for a summary, and https://github.com/theStack/secp256k1lab/blob/add_bip352_module_review_helper/src/secp256k1lab/bip352.py for a Python implementation based on secp256k1lab.\n\nAs the BIP approach suffers from [the worst-case scanning attack](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1698#pullrequestreview-3341766084), following the LabelSet approach with a limit on labels to scan for is the currently suggested way to proceed.",

      "body": "Answering comments https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1792#issuecomment-3709076530 and https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1792#issuecomment-3728203838 here (to keep the discussion in #1792 focused on the LabelSet PR):\n\n@Sjors:\n\n> I think it's fine to initially go for the LabelSet approach, since many current implementations are mobile, which means they benefit from the safety this provides and won't run into the label limit anytime soon.\n\nI agree.\n\n> I do think that hybrid approach is useful. Someone who goes through the trouble of automating label generation might happily add some CPU cores if lets them avoid the complexity of splitting their users across multiple watch keys. Especially if the cost of an attack far outweighs the cost to deal with it.\n\nWhat makes the hybrid approach somewhat unattractive in my opinion is the very clunky API. Users have to pass in the labels information twice, providing both a list of labels and a label cache lookup callback function. The two underlying data structures also have to be maintained and kept in sync accordingly by the user. I would say that this clearly doesn't meet the \"hard to misuse API\" goal that we usually try to follow in this library.\n\n> We could document the hardware required to guarantee that a worst case block takes less than 10 minutes to process. For the hybrid approach that's just a single number IIUC. For the LabelSet approach it's a function of L. With that in place a warning should be enough IMO, for L > ? based on lower end hardware (mobile) and e.g. a 10 second worst case.\n\nDocumenting this makes sense yeah. With \"warning\", I guess you mean something purely in the docs, or is there another way during run-time? (I can't think of any).\n\n@Eunovo:\n\n> I had an offline conversation with @RubenSomsen about this. The conversations around the scanning approaches have been focused on the time it takes to complete a tx scan, but it's also important that we consider the time it takes to scan an entire Block.\n\nThe current per-transaction insights/benchmarks also apply for blocks, if all transactions in a block were equally-sized in terms of number of outputs. That's of course a simplifying assumption, but I think one that is good enough to give a rough estimate in terms of EC point addition cost for common scenarios (see examples below).\n\n> BIP-style scanning scales with the number of outputs, independently of the number of transactions.\n>\n> LabelSet scanning scales with the number of labels * the number of transactions. LabelSet will be Fast when you scan Blocks with few transactions and few labels, but it will get slower compared to BIP-style scanning as the number of transactions increases, even without an increase in the number of labels.\n\nRight. I think what you state is ultimately just a different way of expressing the per-transaction turn-over point inequation $L < 2 * N$ (indicating when LabelSet is faster than BIP), where \"few transactions per block\" maps to a higher N value, and \"high number of transactions per block\" to a lower N value.\n\nTwo concrete example calculations, showing that for up to a few labels, LabelSet approach should be a bit faster:\n* The best-case scenario for the BIP approach is if every transaction consists of only one output (high number of txs per block). Even in that case, for the single-label scenario, the BIP approach has to do twice as many EC point additions per block as for the LabelSet approach (L=1,N=1 => num_txs * 1 < num_txs * 2).\n* A much more realistic scenario is probably to assume that every transaction consists of two outputs (due to change). In that case, scanning up to 3 labels is still faster than the BIP approach (L=3,N=2 => num_txs * 3 < num_txs * 4).\n\n> I think we should do more Block scanning benchmarks. I am interested in doing this myself next week. I can use LabelSet scanning in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32966 and benchmark Block scanning times.\n\nThat's a good idea, looking forward to see results on real-world block data.",

Hence, looking at @theStack's benchmarks, in the long run we should have both the BIP approach and the labelset approach (thanks @w0xlt for coming up with this!).\n\nAs we've discussed, the BIP approach suffers from a quadratic scaling issue under adversarially created transactions. I believe we can address this relatively easily, and I'd prefer to do so before shipping the BIP approach. It would be great to hear thoughts from the BIP authors on this (@RubenSomsen, @josibake). I've discussed possible mitigations with @real-or-random and the ~~most straightforward option seems to be to put a limit on `k`. I do not think this would prevent any realistic use case (I even struggle to imagine a use case that requires more than one `k`)~~ (EDIT: this was based on a misunderstanding, see below). We could run some worst case benchmarks to find a reasonable limit.\n\nI haven't yet looked at the proposed hybrid approach (implementing both approaches under a unified API). What are the advantages? The downside, as mentioned by @theStack, appears to be a clunky API. If there isn't a compelling benefit, I'd lean toward implementing one approach at a time.\n",

      "body": "I calculated the theoretical numbers for comparison. You can view them [here](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/1e827ee6b48a2e4d489d80b400a461de). I'll be referring to these numbers throughout.\n\nLabels allow the recipient to distinguish the source of funds, without requiring another silent payments address (which would scale linearly - 10 addresses means 10x the scanning cost). I think communicating the functionality to users will be a bit of a challenge because it's hard for people to wrap their head arounds the fact that using a different label for the same address still means the address can be linked to the same user (perhaps a name change will help - \"tagged addresses\"?), but regardless, it's clearly a useful feature and it's crucial for non-donation use cases where recipients need to know who paid them (e.g. an exchange receiving funds from users).\n\nHypothetically, if we ignored the issue of the worst-case targeted attack and I had to pick one algorithm, my strong inclination would be to go with the BIP style approach. The primary reason for this is that we get a clear and consistent upper bound on the maximum scanning cost for all users, irrespective of their label usage. The numbers reveal that we only lose a minor amount of performance for users that don't use labels. This performance can be regained in the future by supporting both algorithms.\n\nBut of course we're talking about this because the issue has been hard to ignore. The numbers show that a worst-case targeted attack block is nearly 360x slower (@Eunovo had this benchmarked at 4 minutes on his laptop) than a non-targeted worst-case block.\n\nIf we wanted to work around it, there is one \"soft\" approach - (1) let the API call contain a limited range for K so it has to be called repeatedly. This basically pushes the problem to wallets, which have to decide if and how to communicate this to the user (e.g., \"An unusually large tx contained at least X outputs for you. It's slow to scan but so far contained Y sats. Want to continue?\").\n\nA more strict approach is to simply (2) limit K in the BIP. Technically this is a backwards incompatible change, but in practice no wallets have supported sending multiple outputs to the same recipient so it seems safe to assume this won't have any practical impact. This does raise the question of what we would limit K to. @Sjors came up with a theoretical scenario where users from one exchange are sending money to another exchange, causing a single transaction with lots of different outputs to the same recipient. At K = 1000, I imagine even this type of scenario would be comfortably covered, but this results in 30x slower block validation (~20 seconds?). What upper bound are we willing to accept for the targeted attack?\n\nThe other approach is to (3) go with the LabelSet approach and limit the use of labels. Again, we'd be faced with having to determine a limit, but this time it seems really inevitable it will limit functionality. If we wanted to match the same non-targeted upper bound as the BIP style approach, this would result in a very conservative label limit of 12. And whatever limit we'd pick, if we put it in the BIP, then any future implementation that does want a higher limit will not be BIP compliant.\n\nNote I think even with the BIP style approach we could be more clear about label usage. Currently there is a very non-committal reference to 100k labels (resulting in a ~4MB lookup table) in the BIP. By default, I'd like for most scanning tools to either scan for no labels other than the change label (primarily light clients because to them label usage has bandwidth overhead), or 100k labels. Anyone who wants to go over 100k (or derive labels in a non-standard way) is on their own.\n\nFinally, there is also the idea of (4) putting a lower limit on the number of sats in an eligible output. I think putting this in the BIP is difficult because any reasonable definition of dust would change with the BTC price, and I'm inclined not to explicitly push for this at the wallet level either, but it does make the attack more costly. At the current dust limit, the attacker has to send ~$7000 worth of sats to the (lucky?) victim. On top of that they have to pay one block's worth of fees, though this can be as low as a few hundred dollars.\n\nPersonally, I feel (2) is the most clear-cut approach, assuming we can agree on a reasonable limit for K, but perhaps (1) is also a decent middle ground if we feel the attack is not all that practical but still want to do something about it.\n\nI'd also like to take this moment to appoint @theStack co-author of BIP352. I think he's proven himself more than capable, and with @josibake's current reduced involvement I think it will greatly help move things forward.",

      "body": "Hey Ruben, thanks for the detailed comments. I, more or less, agree with everything you said. A more detailed response:\n\n> (1) let the API call contain a limited range for K so it has to be called repeatedly.\n\nYeah, I had this idea, too. But it doesn't really convince me unless we see actual demand from wallets. I think scanning should be a background process, so it's okay if it takes something on the order of a few seconds but it shouldn't be crazy. (Where do we draw the line exactly? Okay, bikeshedding very much possible...) But this should be well-documented. If it turns out that wallets need to implement some other, more responsive functionality (e.g., some RPC that scans a single transaction and needs to be quick), then we could reconsider that idea. But currently, I don't think it will be necessary.\n\n  > A more strict approach is to simply (2) limit K in the BIP. \n\nThe fact that @jonasnick and I came to the same conclusion that limiting k seems to be a good idea (without knowing that you had suggested the same) probably means we're on the right track. (Yes, when we talked about it, we wrongly assumed that different labels can work with the same k=0, but even if we need different k values for different labels, limiting k seems fine to me.) I agree that limiting k seems much less restrictive for applications than limiting the number of labels.\n\nYet another idea is to require outputs to be in sequential k order, i.e., the k=0 output appears before the k=1 output in the list of outputs which appears before the k=2 output in the list, etc. @jonasnick had suggested this in one of the PR, but wasn't sure whether it limits flexibility too much.\n\nI like this idea, too. It's more straightforward and feels less like a kludge. It should make the scanning linear in the number of outputs, which should get rid of all the performance issues. (Is it reasonable to get a benchmark here?) And having no limit on k is nice because wallet implementors won't need to scratch their heads around it. And I doubt that this approach is too limiting. It precludes any protocol on top of silent payments which would rely on the order of outputs. \n - Some protocols such as LN do indeed rely on the order of outputs. But you probably wouldn't run them on top of SP?\n - It also excludes BIP69, namely the idea that outputs should appear in deterministic (sorted) order to avoid wallet fingerprinting. This is not an unreasonable idea, but it seems that it has mostly been abandoned, with Electrum being the last big wallet to implement it. See https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/8849 and also the report mentioned there. So there's not too much value for SP transactions to blend in with BIP69 transactions.\n\n@RubenSomsen What's your opinion on this idea?\n\nThere's also the possibility to combine this with a maximum k, e.g., k=0 to k=99 may be everywhere in the list but outputs with k >= 100 must be sequential. In that sense, it's even a relaxation of simply limiting k. But this seems a bit overengineered.",

This confirms the assumption that scanning with the \"ordered k\" protocol rule would get rid of all the performance issues.",

      "body": "> > (1) let the API call contain a limited range for K so it has to be called repeatedly.\n> \n> Yeah, I had this idea, too. But it doesn't really convince me unless we see actual demand from wallets. I think scanning should be a background process, so it's okay if it takes something on the order of a few seconds but it shouldn't be crazy. (Where do we draw the line exactly? Okay, bikeshedding very much possible...)\n\nOn mobile there's a couple of lines.\n\nOne line is at about 1/100th of a second. Anything that takes longer would block smooth scrolling, since the UI is typically the main thread (disclaimer: it's been a decade since implemented an iOs app that had to worry about this, but [it's still a thing](https://medium.com/lets-code-future/scroll-like-butter-mastering-smooth-scrolling-in-swiftui-ios-18-xcode-16-ready-d821aab44bd5)). That means it needs to be done in a background thread. If we're going to be well above that anyway, then the mobile developer can't avoid using a background thread and we don't have to worry about this particular line.\n\nHaving to use a background thread means they have to worry about thread safety. Although it could still be a single long running thread, dedicated to libsecp operations. But then you can't sign anything, or do any other secp operation, while a heavy block is being scanned. So perhaps developers need to worry about thread safety anyway, and this doesn't make it worse. And perhaps most operations are safe anyway, e.g. scan 1 block, sign a transaction, scan the next block, doesn't really interfere?\n\nStill, (mobile) UI needs to give some feedback to the user. It can be a block height that frequently goes up, or a progress bar that gradually moves. There I would say that a few seconds is the max you want to go by without any feedback, or the user might think the app is frozen.\n\nIf a specific block takes exceptionally long, it's probably also good to show the user something to relax them. That's easier to implement if the call returns after a second or so, saying it needs more. The alternative if for the developer to implement yet another thread that measures the time a call takes and compares it to a baseline.\n\n@theStack wrote:\n\n> Benchmark results on my arm64 laptop:\n\nDesktop users are probably more patient anyway. I think we should measure the performance on mobile phones. Perhaps not the slowest one out there, although it would be nice if the slowest known smartphone that can run an application with libsecp, gets an answer from the library within 1 second.",

      "body": "> `k` changes whenever multiple outputs are sent to the same recipient, irrespective of what label is used.\n\nSorry, that was a significant error in my mental model (at least my most recent one). In that case, I agree that having more than one `k` _is_ a relevant use case and I take back what I said about restricting `k` being obviously the most straightforward option.\n\nAnnother thought on the limited-k vs. ordered-k approaches: limited-k appears to lead to a more secure libsecp API. The limit would be enforced in the `secp256k1_silentpayments_sender_create_outputs` function. If it's exceeded, the function returns an error and no transaction will be made.\n\nWith the ordered-k approach we'd instead have to add a warning to the API doc of `sender_create_outputs` stating that the generated outputs must appear exactly in the same order in the transaction. If the wallet would (accidentally) ignore the warning and, e.g., sort the outputs via BIP 69 before making a transaction, it would be a mess to recover the coins.\n",

A transaction with N=23255 outputs is created, where the matched outputs in the same recipient group (of size K) are placed at the very end, at positions [N-K, N-1], in order to maximize the total number of iterations of the inner loop.\n\nThese are useful numbers, and they confirm that scanning takes O(K * N). I believe for picking a reasonable max `K_max`, we'd rather want to look at entire blocks, as brought up by @Eunovo. The worst-case block is probably one filled with transactions, each having `N = K_max` many outputs. And then we'll start to see the \"quadratic\" impact when considering different `K_max` values. For example, what's the scanning time for a block filled with `N = K_max = 1000` transactions vs. a block filled with (about 10x as many) `N = K_max = 100` transactions?\n",

      "body": "> > Here are worst-case benchmarks for both of these proposed protocol fixes (I called them \"limited k\" and \"ordered k\" rules): [theStack@edf222f](https://github.com/theStack/secp256k1/commit/edf222f2106cd45fbaf2f1d47ee87a774c35d42a) (based on [#1765](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1765)). A transaction with N=23255 outputs is created, where the matched outputs in the same recipient group (of size K) are placed at the very end, at positions [N-K, N-1], in order to maximize the total number of iterations of the inner loop.\n> \n> These are useful numbers, and they confirm that scanning takes O(K * N). I believe for picking a reasonable max `K_max`, we'd rather want to look at entire blocks, as brought up by [@Eunovo](https://github.com/Eunovo). The worst-case block is probably one filled with transactions, each having `N = K_max` many outputs. And then we'll start to see the \"quadratic\" impact when considering different `K_max` values. For example, what's the scanning time for a block filled with `N = K_max = 1000` transactions vs. a block filled with (about 10x as many) `N = K_max = 100` transactions?\n\nFair point. ~~Note that for transactions where all outputs match (with `N = K_max`), the \"quadratic\" impact can be easily avoided by marking found outputs and skipping those in further iterations (that's currently already done in #1765). If we want to keep that optimization, I'd assume that the worst-case scanning cost per block is reached by maximizing the number of unmatched outputs (in contrast to any found output, those have to be processed over and over again, blowing the cost up) in a single transaction.~~\n\nEDIT: Sorry, that was wrong. If the matched outputs are ordered in reverse by an adversary (i.e. from max_k-1...0), then marking and skipping found outputs alone doesn't gain anything.",

I assume @RubenSomsen reached a similar conclusion, since in the [gist writeup](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/1e827ee6b48a2e4d489d80b400a461de), the \"targeted attack\" scenario only considers the single-transaction, maximum-N case.\n\n>  And this matches exactly the benchmarks you've already produced, right?\n\nYes.\n\n> With the ordered-k approach we'd instead have to add a warning to the API doc of sender_create_outputs stating that the generated outputs must appear exactly in the same order in the transaction. If the wallet would (accidentally) ignore the warning and, e.g., sort the outputs via BIP 69 before making a transaction, it would be a mess to recover the coins.\n\nAnother potential drawback of the \"ordered-k\" rule is that it breaks existing test vectors in the BIP, which currently explicitly check that order does _not_ matter. Adapting those is probably not the end of the world, but in comparison the \"limited-k\" rule is significantly easier to cope with in that regards (and probably less confusing for existing SP wallets testing against the vectors), as only new test vectors would be added; currently, the [largest test case w.r.t. number of outputs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/ecb074d487ac709c6321a5b85a6d081bd20ff30b/bip-0352/send_and_receive_test_vectors.json#L2133) is N=4. So in that sense \"ordered-k\" feels slightly more like a breaking change than \"limited-k\".",

      "body": "@real-or-random thanks for your comments.\n\n>require outputs to be in sequential k order\n\nOther than what was already mentioned about \"ordered-k\", I'm also concerned what putting restrictions on output order does to privacy. If a known SP user sends you money from the 1st and 5th output in a tx, it implies they own the 2nd, 3rd and 4th output as well. And in coinjoin scenarios, you now have to insist on a certain order for outputs, which reveals information to other coinjoin participants. \n\n@theStack \n\n>I assume @RubenSomsen reached a similar conclusion, since in the [gist writeup](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/1e827ee6b48a2e4d489d80b400a461de), the \"targeted attack\" scenario only considers the single-transaction, maximum-N case.\n\nYes, a single tx with maximum N is the worst case for two reasons:\n\n1. The attack scales directly with the number of outputs, and a single tx is the optimal way to maximize them\n\n2. Whenever limit-K approaches N, you can get an up to 2x speedup by removing checked outputs (note I am assuming the outputs are always randomized). This is why in my [gist](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/1e827ee6b48a2e4d489d80b400a461de) I have a different formula for the \"limit K\" scenario and the unlimited \"worst case\" scenario (where K == N).\n\n@w0xlt\n\n>Wallet label count constraint (L ≤ 500) instead of protocol constraint (limited-k)\n\nI think one important point of nuance is that the slowdown from using labels under LabelSet is consistently present. _Every_ user who approaches L=500 will forever be up to 4x slower than BIP style (non-targeted). Under BIP style, if limit K=120 then only _one_ user will be 4x slower (and everyone else will actually be ~3x faster) for as long as that user is being attacked.\n\nI understand not everyone is sold on labels, and it's uncertain what adoption will be like, but I do feel pretty confident in saying we're far more likely to see high label usage than anyone trying to make transactions with lots of outputs to the same recipient in the foreseeable future. Labels enable some pretty common use cases, such as knowing who paid you, accompanying a payment with a description before the payment is made, and even the ability to spend funds that were sent to some set of labels separately from your other funds.\n\n---\n\nLet me test the waters with a concrete proposal - how would people feel about a K=1000 limit (~31x slower, benchmarked at 16 seconds by @theStack)? That's a limit no future use case would conceivably hit in practice. If someone attacked you for a _full day_, filling 144 blocks with outputs to you, UX wise the scanning experience will be equivalent to having been offline for month and then coming back online (and everyone else gets to scan those 144 blocks ~3x faster than normal).",
