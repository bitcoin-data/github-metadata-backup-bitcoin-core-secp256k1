    "body": "Existing 'best effort' zeriozation for private data is hardly even best effort. At a minimum we should consider doing this via an extern-ed function and memset_s if available. No guarantees can still be provided, of course.\n\nWe might also consider wrapping the API entrance of private data handling functions like:\n\nhandle_data(){ \n  ret=handle_data_impl();\n  handle_data_zero_stack(); \n  return ret;\n}\n\nWhere _zero_stack uses slightly more stack than the whole callgraph for _impl and zeros it, in order to catch private data spilled onto the stack during execution before returning outside of our control.\n\nI'm not sure where exactly where the line between best effort and security theatre is... there is only so much that can really be done (esp in portable code) here.\n",

      "description": "Motivation: libsecp is already widely used today, but often in a terribly outdated version. It's likely that a release process would help with that. Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",

      "body": "@briansmith  As Pieter noted, the compiler can and will store arbitrary secret data in random places on the stack (in fact, it can even stash them in random globals and such). This isn't just hypothetical either.\n\nIt can also leave them sitting around in registers, and from there other code can save them onto the stack or other locations where they might escape.\n\nI'm dubious about the value of having memset_s() in the standard: I'll gladly use it for better best effort; but I think the standards committee made an error in judgement-- since it leads to incorrect reasoning about what can actually be accomplished.\n\nSo the best we can do is best-effort; maybe best effort with some non-runtime tests (e.g. load secrets with known patterns and search the stack for them after execution). I'm all for best effort where better can't be done. Approaches like I suggested of flushing out the stack have a fighting chance at being reliable at least for now... though even that isn't guaranteed to work; e.g. you can't guarantee the compiler will give the zero_stack function accesses to the redzone on architectures that have them, if zero_stack is just plain old C.\n",

For building on #448 I think I'll switch to memset + memory barrier where this is available (GCC, clang) because it does not require external libraries incl. glibc, and the compiler can still optimize the memset (just not optimize it *out*). The USENIX paper confirms that this is good performance-wise.\r\n\r\nAs a fallback, we can try to use platform-specific functions or a volatile store, I need to see how ugly it gets.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Bitcoin Core currently uses memset + memory barrier or Windows's SecureZeroMemory:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/support/cleanse.cpp#L31\r\n(However, note the weird logic: On Windows, the memory is cleared twice.)\r\nThis  restricts Core to GCG, clang or MSVC.
