E.g.\n- Secret keys are chosen uniformly at random and in an unpredictable way.\n- Message hashes are the output of a cryptographic hash. (In particular, you can't be caused to sign 0 or verify the signature of 0 (which can be trivially forged))\n- You correctly check the return values of the functions, and correctly supply their inputs\n- The C compiler or computer has not undermined the operation of the software\n- The authors and reviewers of the software made no errors which are not detected by the included tests\n- You obtained a faithful copy of the software\n- Your computers operation is not excessively observable or modifiable by an attacker.\n- The discrete Log problem is hard for the secp256k1 algebraic group\n- The ECDSA signature algorithm is as strong as the discrete log problem\n\netc.\n",

      "description": "Motivation: libsecp is already widely used today, but often in a terribly outdated version. It's likely that a release process would help with that. Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",
