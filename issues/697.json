If we add the point to itself `n` times (where `n` is the field order) we will get the same original point. Is the overflow flag tells about this? If yes, why it prevents from doing the tweak?\r\n\r\nFor instance, knowing the original public key, and knowing the curve parameters, I can compose a tweaking factor that is equal to `n` so the tweak procedure always results the same original public key. However, I would not be able to compose a message, that results in the digest equial to `n`, so at least for commitment procedures this should be not a problem.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, coming back to the issue https://github.com/sipa/bips/issues/152 it seems that usage of SHA256 instead of HMAC can allow the attacker (very theoretically) to compose a message which hash will result in `n`, opening possibility for instance to claim that any public key is committed for the equivalent message, which bytecode can be re-interpreted under different protocols opening a way for a hack.",

This is already covered by the possibility for libsecp256k1  to return a failure (non-1 value) from the`ecp256k1_ec_pubkey_tweak_add` function: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/e541a90ef6461007d9c6a74b9f9a7fb8aa34aaa8/src/secp256k1.c#L596. Also, the function theoretically may fail b/c the tweaking factor exceeds the elliptic curve field order, however this fact is, according to https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/137d304a6bf419bbbafd70d1dbdb2162354d71b7/src/scalar_low_impl.h#L58, always ignored.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if the function may deterministicaly fail for a given tweak (i.e. resulting hash from some input data, added *G to the intermediate public key) the specification should encounter for the possible reaction to the case.

      "body": "> Right, sorry, I found it. But why the overflow is important for the key tweaking? \r\n\r\nScalars are numbers in Z_p, which are typically represented by the integers 0..p-1 (where p is the group order of the elliptic curve group secp256k1, not the field order). An overflow is basically a number s >= p.\r\n\r\nNow there are two ways to look at it:\r\n - You can say that integers s >= p are simply invalid representations, and we don't want invalid scalars.\r\n - You can interpret a 256-bit s >= p by taking it mod p. Then the resulting integer is in range again but then there are a few scalars now which have two 256-bit representations instead of just one. That means that taking an uniform 256-bit integer is not equivalent to taking an uniform scalar in Z_p. We don't want that either.\r\n\r\nHowever, overflow happens with negligible probability for a random tweak, so it's not an issue that the function fails here.",
