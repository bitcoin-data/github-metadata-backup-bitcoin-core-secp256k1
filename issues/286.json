The library has been around for a couple of years ago and is considered stable.\n\nIt is commonly known as secp256k1 (rather than libsecp256k1) and provides a `secp256k1.h` header.

          "body": "This issue is outside of this project's control, but I'm hoping that I can drum up some support to push the right project for a solution. I'm also not able to submit an issue to [libbitcoin/secp256k1](https://github.com/libbitcoin/secp256k1).\r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\nI'd like to create a Homebrew formula of this project. My ultimate goal was to create one for libbitcoin-explorer, but after following the dependency chain all the way to secp256k1, I realized I couldn't make a formula because it does not have a tagged release. Since a tagged release is a requirement for Homebrew formulae, this means that none of the libbitcoin projects can be installed via Homebrew.\r\n\r\n## Purpose\r\n\r\nThe advantage of creating Homebrew formulae for the libbitcoin projects is making installation of something like libbitcoin-explorer as easy as\r\n```\r\nbrew install libbitcoin-explorer\r\n```\r\nThe macOS installation instructions for many of the libbitcoin projects already use Homebrew to install dependencies, such as boost. This would take the extra step of making libbitcoin installation trivial.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nThere is currently a 2 year old open issue for this at https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286. I have to think that this blocks many other Homebrew formulae from being created, if they want to depend on secp256k1. **I'm requesting that if others are interested in Homebrew formulae for libbitcoin projects, they bump the thread to create a tagged release.** I hope this gets their attention, but I'm not 100% certain it will.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, there is an unofficial tap at https://github.com/DomT4/homebrew-crypto, but I thought it best to avoid using it when submitting a formula to the official Homebrew repo.",

I noticed the PR's for java bindings, and I wondered if it might be worth moving the code here? \n\nI'm not sure if anyone else is developing these, but mainly asking since I'm experimenting with packaging the extension as .deb package, but I need to ensure that libsecp256k1 is installed on the system as well.\n\nI know it's quite early for a secp256k1-dev package in apt, but since I'm now considering gitian builds to produce a .deb for this extension, the same could be done for the library itself. If we keep the sources here we can build each binding/release in the one gitian build. \n\nThe bindings are here: https://github.com/Bit-Wasp/secp256k1-php, and there are tests for pretty much everything besides the privkey_import/export functions(). Yet to include the edge cases (r/s = 0, etc), but it's standing up pretty well. It is my first foray into C in a while, so I'd appreciate all the feedback I can get!\n\nAnyway, interested to hear what people think, I can follow up with a PR if people are happy enough!\n",

To the extent that the properties of the libsecp256k1 might mismatch the expectations of a user it's least likely to occur in Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nBitcoin's usage also is heedful of this. It does not link a system library which might change out from under it and break consensus in some way-- it embeds it. It also doesn't use features of the library like gmp bignum that its harder to be confident of the stability of...\r\n\r\nI don't think there is anything conceptually big that would prevent making a tagged release, but when there isn't much effort going into it even small things are big.  I don't benefit from there being a tagged release, rather, I expect that it would create some additional cost from demands to keep interfaces more stable... so it isn't something that I would personally have prioritized.\r\n\r\nI'm no longer involved except commenting to avoid unnecessarily leaving a knowledge vacuum, so it isn't like my position actually matters, but if you're going to invoke me as some kind of barrier I figure I should comment. :)\r\n",

I'm working both on moving `libsecp256k1` to it's own formula so it can be used independently of `libbitcoin` as well as `ruby-secp256k1` as native bindings for Ruby.  In order to support this we need to be able to refer to a cut release of `libsecp256k1`.  While I understand that it is not v1 yet, cutting a v0.8 or v0.9 for the non-experimental modules of core, ecdh, and recovery would enable wider adoption and contributions to this library.\r\n\r\nThe ask is to create a pre v1 release for homebrew.",
