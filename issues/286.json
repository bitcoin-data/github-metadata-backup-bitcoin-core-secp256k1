To the extent that the properties of the libsecp256k1 might mismatch the expectations of a user it's least likely to occur in Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nBitcoin's usage also is heedful of this. It does not link a system library which might change out from under it and break consensus in some way-- it embeds it. It also doesn't use features of the library like gmp bignum that its harder to be confident of the stability of...\r\n\r\nI don't think there is anything conceptually big that would prevent making a tagged release, but when there isn't much effort going into it even small things are big.  I don't benefit from there being a tagged release, rather, I expect that it would create some additional cost from demands to keep interfaces more stable... so it isn't something that I would personally have prioritized.\r\n\r\nI'm no longer involved except commenting to avoid unnecessarily leaving a knowledge vacuum, so it isn't like my position actually matters, but if you're going to invoke me as some kind of barrier I figure I should comment. :)\r\n",
