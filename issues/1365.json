It also provides exact algorithm to calculate nonce from it.\r\n\r\nRight now, libsecp256k1, when auxRand was not passed, uses its own nonce generation algorithm.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to make the library follow specification.",

          "body": "I am currently using the noble library to maintain a Bitcoin package, [`@bitcoinerlab/secp256k1`](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/secp256k1), that aligns with the interface of tiny-secp256k1 in the bitcoinjs-lib ecosystem. This package is ultimately dependent on the bitcoin-core/secp256k1 library.\r\n\r\nRecently, an [issue](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/secp256k1/issues/3) was reported in our package related to the inconsistency of Schnorr signatures when `auxRand` is not passed.\r\n\r\nUpon investigation, I noted a discrepancy in the strategy used to handle `auxRand` when it's not passed. In noble-curves and noble-secp256k1 1.7, `auxRand` defaults to a random value if it's not passed, as seen in [this line of code](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-curves/blob/5609ec7644c517acc3e990582f630f5dd4d4fbd0/src/secp256k1.ts#L160).\r\n\r\nHowever, the bitcoin-core/secp256k1 library handles this scenario differently, opting for a deterministic approach when `auxRand` is not provided.\r\n\r\nI understand this is not a bug in noble-curves, and the chosen strategy is both safe and valid. However, given these differences, I'm finding it challenging to use noble to accurately emulate the behaviour of bitcoin-core/secp256k1 when `auxRand` isn't provided (without resorting to forking noble-curves).\r\n\r\nDue to the hashing, I believe it's not practically feasible to precompute an `auxRand` that would result in the same deterministic behaviour as in bitcoin-core/secp256k1.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate your insights and guidance on this issue. Is there a workaround or a potential modification I can implement to align the handling of `auxRand` more closely with the bitcoin-core/secp256k1 approach?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n",

I think there is some confusion.\r\n\r\n* noble-curves, if no auxrand is specified, generates 32 random bytes and uses those.\r\n* libsecp256k1, if no auxrand is specified, acts as if 32 0x00 bytes are passed.\r\n\r\nBoth are BIP340 compliant (emphasis mine):\r\n\r\n> If randomness is not available at all at signing time, a simple counter wide enough to not repeat in practice (e.g., 64 bits or wider) and padded with null bytes to a 32 byte-array can be used, **or even the constant array with 32 null bytes**. Using any non-repeating value increases protection against [fault injection attacks](https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/curves/2017/000925.html). Using unpredictable randomness additionally increases protection against other side-channel attacks, and is recommended whenever available.\r\n\r\nUsing random nonces is recommended and obviously better, but libsecp256k1 has no access to high-quality randomness; it's up to the caller to provide it.",
