My reason is simply that other projects (primarily\r\nrust-bitcoin, Miniscript and Simplicity) are taking too much of my attention\r\nand as a result I have basically been an absentee maintainer for all of 2020\r\nand 2021. It would be prudent that I no longer have merge access to the\r\nrepository.\r\n\r\nI will, of course, continue to participate in the project as a contributor,\r\nand I have no intention of reducing my role in the wider Bitcoin community\r\nor stepping down as maintainer of any other projects (including libsecp-zkp).\r\nI am just reflecting the reality that I haven't been active as a maintainer\r\nand therefore ought not to call myself one.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nAndrew\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\niQEzBAEBCAAdFiEEkPnKPD7Je+ki35VexYjWPOQbl8EFAmGConkACgkQxYjWPOQb\r\nl8FTrQgAiXYxfigEkCA2hTlyalZAqfqqfamdMREypHYzeM3paYQ3CVeaku+Oeek/\r\nqHg9cV5F9MjFXt+uFilIqobmiqIYV6FodYGs8AH4lEm2O1RQOQtcOtePs7CPgfth\r\ny2V1u0rYV6Y5s+rN86IXU1F5gS5W9kxYdjD7VqJJfPzhSFMZMNbzaTizgobDtHwn\r\nJNJHMHwviLyJm5kujyefoVW4bQyjMWF+ijPIhosR6IJsMjrHG2t4zAC9tlrOA2Qc\r\ny1clbQgV+nNehwC8drUbVsVNQW2kkK3svoCR+vmRJ4QPrWFMPxd1MvDnCSZEx5ks\r\nffe9nKx06md1KlwXOpI+ofy9gVvFtg==\r\n=P2ZM\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n```\r\nMy PGP key is at https://www.wpsoftware.net/andrew/andrew.gpg and on the keyservers.\r\n\r\nFeel free to close this issue, just posting here to make it public.",
