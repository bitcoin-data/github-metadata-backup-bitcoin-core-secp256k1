          "title": "tests: refactor: tidy up util functions (#1491)",
          "body": "This PR is an attempt at tidying up test util functions, as suggested in #1491. The following changes are done:\r\n* rename `_group_element...` functions to `_ge...`\r\n* rename `_field_element...` functions to `_fe...`\r\n* move `random_` helpers from tests.c to testutil.h (the alternative would be testrand.h, but to my understanding, this one is meant to contain the actual RNG implementation rather than helpers using it; happy to move the helpers there if that is preferred though)\r\n* prefix testutil.h functions with `testutil_`\r\n* prefix testrand.h functions with `testrand_` (this is currently done in a sloppy way by simply dropping the `secp256k1_` prefix, so some functions don't have the full prefix, like e.g. `testrand256`; naming suggestions welcome)",

          "title": "Add BIP352 `silentpayments` module",
          "body": "This PR adds a new Silent Payments ([BIP352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458)) module to secp256k1. It is a continuation of the work started in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1471.\r\n\r\nThe module implements the full protocol, except for transaction input filtering and silent payment address encoding / decoding as those will be the responsibility of the wallet software. It is organized with functions for sending (prefixed with `_sender`) and receiving (prefixed by `_recipient`).\r\n\r\n#### For sending\r\n\r\n1. Collect private keys into two lists: `taproot_seckeys` and `plain_seckeys`\r\n    Two lists are used since the `taproot_seckeys` may need negation. `taproot_seckeys` are passed as keypairs to avoid the function needing to compute the public key to determine parity. `plain_seckeys` are passed as just secret keys\r\n2. Create the `_silentpayment_recipient` objects\r\n    These structs hold the scan and spend public key and an index for remembering the original ordering. It is expected that a caller will start with a list of silent payment addresses (with the desired amounts), convert these into an array of `recipients` and then match the generated outputs back to the original silent payment addresses. The index is used to return the generated outputs in the original order\r\n3. Call `silentpayments_sender_create_outputs` to generate the xonly public keys for the recipients\r\n    This function can be called with one or more recipients. The same recipient may be repeated to generate multiple outputs for the same recipient\r\n    \r\n#### For scanning\r\n\r\n1. Collect the public keys into two lists `taproot_pubkeys` and `plain_pubeys`\r\n    This avoids the caller needing to convert taproot public keys into compressed public keys (and vice versa)\r\n2. Compute the input data needed, i.e. sum the public keys and compute the `input_hash`\r\n    This is done as a separate step to allow the caller to reuse this output if scanning for multiple scan keys. It also allows a caller to use this function for aggregating the transaction inputs and storing them in an index to vend to light clients later (or for faster rescans when recovering a wallet)\r\n4. Call `silentpayments_recipient_scan_outputs` to scan the transaction outputs and return the tweak data (and optionally label information) needed for spending later\r\n\r\nIn addition, a few utility functions for labels are provided for the recipient for creating a label tweak and tweaked spend public key for their address. Finally, two functions are exposed in the API for supporting light clients, `_recipient_created_shared_secret` and `_recipient_create_output_pubkey`. These functions enable incremental scanning for scenarios where the caller does not have access to the transaction outputs:\r\n\r\n1. Calculating a shared secret\r\n    This is done as a separate step to allow the caller to reuse the shared secret result when creating outputs and avoid needing to do a costly ECDH every time they need to check for an additional output\r\n3. Generate an output (with `k = 0`)\r\n5. Check if the output exists in the UTXO set (using their preferred light client protocol)\r\n6. If the output exists, proceed by generating a new output from the shared secret with `k++`\r\n\r\nSee `examples/silentpayments.c` for a demonstration of how the API is expected to be used.\r\n\r\n### Note for reviewers\r\n\r\nMy immediate goal is to get feedback on the API so that I can pull this module into https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122 (silent payments in the bitcoin core wallet). That unblocks from finishing the bitcoin core PRs while work continues on this module.\r\n\r\n#### Notable differences between this PR and the previous version\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1427 and https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1471 for discussions on the API design. This iteration of the module attempts to be much more high level and incorporate the feedback from #1471. I also added a `secp256k1_silentpayments_public_data` opaque data type, which contains the summed public key and the input_hash. My motivation here was:\r\n\r\n1. I caught myself mixing up the order of arguments between `A_sum` and `recipient_spend_key`, which was impossible to catch with `ARG_CHECKS` and would result in the scanning process finishing without errors, but not finding any outputs\r\n2. Combining public key and input_hash into the same data type allows for completely hiding `input_hash` from the caller, which makes for an overall simpler API IMO\r\n\r\nI also removed the need for the recipient to generate a shared secret before using the `secp256k1_silentpayments_recipient_scan_outputs` function and instead create the shared secret inside the function.\r\n\r\n### Outstanding work\r\n\r\n- [ ] clean up the testing code\r\n- [ ] improve test coverage (currently only using the BIP352 test vectors)\r\n- [ ] optimize the implementation, where possible",
