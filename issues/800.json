    "body": "If secp256k1.c is built without SECP256K1_BUILD the non-null argument tests get compiled out and then the tests crash.\r\n\r\nOne way to address that would be to simply have test.c and secp256k1.c set the macro before importing the headers. I think this would be pretty fool-proof.  If there is some reason that can't be done secp256k1.c compile could fail if SECP256K1_BUILD isn't set.  I prefer the foolproof way because demanding the build system set some define is more trouble for users that aren't using the build system.\r\n\r\nRelated, USE_FIELD_INV_BUILTIN/USE_SCALAR_INV_BUILTIN should get automatically defaulted.  (maybe these go away with safegcd?)  right now a non-buildsystem user needs to set them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps for the rest too... I think now that there aren't defines needed for the fe/scalar type it should be possible to build with zero defines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
