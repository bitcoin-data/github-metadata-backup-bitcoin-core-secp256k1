In particular, the z-coordinate will always be the same for the first step of the scalar multiplication, which processes the MSBs of the scalar. (The more steps we do, the more z-coord of the accumulator point will randomized, even though this is not easy to reason about due to our addition formula.) \r\n\r\nThe proposal is to call `secp256k1_gej_rescale(&ctx->initial, ...)` at the beginning of every ecmult_gen multiplication. The randomness can derived from the secrets available in the current high-level operation, i.e., the seckey during pubkey generation, and seckey||message during signing.",

(But then I wonder why we clear the coordinates here:) https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/98dac87839838b86094f1bccc71cc20e67b146cc/src/group_impl.h#L184-L189",
