    "title": "use EXIT_ codes instead of magic numbers for exit(...) and main return values",
    "body": "This is really only a minor issue, but I noticed while reviewing #1479 that the return codes of functions in the examples could potentially be confusing. Throughout the API and internal functions we use 0=failure/1=success, while for the main function and (`exit(...)`) it's the other way round, i.e. 0=success/1=failure. We could use `EXIT_{SUCCESS,FAILURE}` (defined in stdlib.h, see https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/program/EXIT_status) for the latter instead for more clarity.\r\n\r\nSee e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9067/commits/4441018d0860fce64ee74fa78da79bbb21114ca9 for a comparable change in Bitcoin Core as orientation. This could be a good first issue.",
