I'd hoped previously to get some researchers working in this space interested; but so far no luck.\n",

      "body": "@andres-erbsen I can start.\r\n\r\nI've done verification of the int128_struct module using [VST](https://vst.cs.princeton.edu/).  The specification and proofs can be found at https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/simplicity/blob/139ab8d6f455e8d1cc10ad3693e917d2852e1bf3/Coq/C/secp256k1/verif_int128_impl.v, and there is a interactive log of the proof at https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ElementsProject/simplicity/blob/139ab8d6f455e8d1cc10ad3693e917d2852e1bf3/alectryon/verif_int128_impl.v.html\r\n\r\nI'm working my way from the bottom up, and the int128_struct module is one of the main leaves of the development, upon which the field, scalar, and modular inverse operations are built upon.\r\n\r\nFor licensing reasons, the proof lives in the Simplicity project, and will be limited in scope to those parts of libsecp256k1 that have been imported into the Simplicity project.\r\n\r\nLately I've been working on the correctness of the modular inverse operations.  This fits in with our existing proof of the termination of the safeGCD algorithm at <https://medium.com/blockstream/a-formal-proof-of-safegcd-bounds-695e1735a348> and is more interesting for vetting the VST tool since it is full of loops and breaks and branches, whereas a lot of the other libsecp256k1 code is straight-line and branchless (for good reason of course) . I don't have a public branch at this time, but I'm at approximately line 265:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/simplicity/blob/139ab8d6f455e8d1cc10ad3693e917d2852e1bf3/C/secp256k1/modinv64_impl.h#L265\r\n\r\n(Note however `secp256k1_modinv64_divsteps_59` has been excluded from verification as it is not used in Simplicity.)\r\n\r\nMy current plan is to finish off the proof of `secp256k1_modinv64_divsteps_62_var` and then turn my attention to the field_inner_mul operations for comparison with fiat-crypto.  I had done an early test of verifying these operations in VST a long time ago.",

      "body": "I've finished the correctness proofs in VST of `secp256k1_fe_mul_inner` and `secp256k1_fe_sqr_inner`.  You can find the rendered proof at <https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ElementsProject/simplicity/blob/verif_field_5x52_int128_impl_0/alectryon/verif_field_5x52_int128_impl.v.html>.\r\n\r\nThe more relevant bit is the formal specification of the functions that the proofs relate to.  These are `secp256k1_fe_mul_inner_spec` and `secp256k1_fe_sqr_inner_spec` which have rendered versions at <https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ElementsProject/simplicity/blob/verif_field_5x52_int128_impl_0/alectryon/spec_field_5x52.v.html>.\r\n\r\nThese specifications are written in the formal separation logic language of VST.  These specification are made somewhat complicated by needing to support the fact that the `r` parameter may or may not alias the `a` parameter.  To that end, I've written \"sub-specifications\" `secp256k1_fe_mul_inner_spec_restrict` and `secp256k1_fe_mul_inner_spec_alias` which provided somewhat simpler specification for the specific cases where `r` does not/does alias `a`.  These sub-specifications can be found in the same file, along with the proofs that these are indeed sub-specifications of the formal specification.\r\n\r\nMore at https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1319#issuecomment-1821834018.",
