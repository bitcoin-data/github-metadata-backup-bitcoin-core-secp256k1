While computing the inverse of a privatekey is a low-level operation, I suspect it's only done in contexts in which it's a required operation that would be implemented anyway (i.e. it's not subverting otherwise high-level functionality).\r\n\r\nI notice it's also implemented by quite a few EC libraries and bindings as well, so I suspect if this library exposes it, it'll only be less likely to implemented badly. \r\n\r\nIn my case, it's a required operation of a blinded signature scheme I am working with. I don't really have the luxury of avoiding it, it's just a question of if I can use libsecp256k1 already efficient implementation or my own slow crappy version. \r\n\r\nAlso is it much different than something like `secp256k1_ec_privkey_negate` ?",

      "body": "If we were compiled without ECDSA verification I believe we would have no use for a scalar negate in the library at all.\r\n\r\nProbably your \"blinded signature scheme\" is insecure.  I'd actually take a sizable bet because essentially every description I've seen of ECC blind signing I've seen online was insecure as described (and also failed to even mention the risks).\r\n\r\nIf getting access to some libsecp256k1 internal is getting in your way, then you probably have a more serious problem you're not even aware of...  this is part of the reason for our motivation in not offering a grabbag of low level primitives.  If you'd like to implement blind signing against the schnorr PRs in the repo, I'd be happy to review them. Blind signing is among the operations I'd like to see the library provide for it...",
