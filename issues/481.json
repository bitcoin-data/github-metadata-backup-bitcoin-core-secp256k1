At the moment I freeze by commit hash, but it would be nice to have some releases.\r\nDon't wait too much to have the perfect initial release, just [release early, release early](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often) and you would be fine :smiley: \r\nThis library is already used in many projects anyway.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know how to tag it, don't bother with semantic versioning and just go with the `vYYYYMMDD` format, Ubuntu-style-ish.",
