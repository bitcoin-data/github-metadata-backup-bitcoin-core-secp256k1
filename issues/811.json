      "description": "Motivation: libsecp is already widely used today, but often in a terribly outdated version. It's likely that a release process would help with that. Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",

So it is *much* better to have a reliable abort, because aborting essentially always safer than an RCE, and also  that sort of misuse will likely end up aborting closer to every time, rather than looking kinda like it worked.\r\n\r\n(it would even be better if all the structures had canaries, so that invalid but coincidentally all zeros also got detected)\r\n",
