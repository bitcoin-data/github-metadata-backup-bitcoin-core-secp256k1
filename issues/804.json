      "body": "I think @gmaxwell can say more about the memory requirements but one very simple issue with the current tests that they don't run on bare-metal targets because they assume:\r\n - CLI parameters (`argc`,  `argv`) \r\n - `fopen` and `/dev/urandom` if you don't pass the seed on the command line (this is even an issue on non-cygwin windows!)\r\n - `printf` \r\n\r\nIf you want to run tests on bare-metal targets, you anyway need to do some manual work but maybe we should at least make it as easy as possible. I once wanted to run the tests on Trezor but then was too lazy, and used a different ARM target with a compatible instruction set instead.  \r\n\r\nThis related to #593.  ",

It should be easier to run a signing-relevant-stuff-only test.\r\n\r\nThe verify contexts use a huge amount of ram currently, and the tests allocate several at once. Your typical hardware wallet doesn't really care that much about verify performance (if it's linking verify at all!)-- see #614 \r\n\r\nAt several places the tests put an a rather large amount of data on the stack: in some cases just single objects are big secp256k1_scalar sr[512] but also because there are test functions that use a lot which could be easily split into other functions. It would be nice if the library avoided using more than 4kb of stack (or could be configured that way at least) and if the tests didn't use more than 8kb of stack.\r\n",
