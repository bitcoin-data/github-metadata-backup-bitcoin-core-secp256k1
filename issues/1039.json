    "title": "Make all source and header files self-contained",
    "body": "This week I noticed that the includes in this project are a mess. Actually, each file should be self-contained, i.e., include the stuff that it needs (and ideally only the stuff that it needs) but at the moment neither of these are true for a lot of files in the repo. Just try compiling a random `.h` or `_impl.h` file.\r\n\r\nThis is not per se a problem for our \"single translation unit\" compilation (I learned that the cool kids call this [\"unity builds\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_build)) that we use in order to leverage the full potential of compiler optimizations without the need for LTO. The more important point (at least for me personally--though I may be the only regular contributor suffering here), it prevents the use of advanced tooling/IDE, e.g., my editor supports language servers such as ccls or clangd which \"compile\" the open file internally and provide a ton of features, e.g., completion, display of compile errors etc. But [none of this works properly](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/45) if you can't compile individual files. You can say that's the fault of these tools but [self-contained files are also just good style and good engineering practice](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines.html#sf11-header-files-should-be-self-contained).\r\n\r\nPR #924 was an attempt to clean up the includes but even the `include-what-you-use` tool there used there (or at least the way it has been used there) fixes includes only for the `.c` files.\r\n  \r\nHere are some things we'd need to do:\r\n- [ ] Introduce header files for modules: Currently each `_impl.h` file in `src` has a corresponding `.h` file for other files to include. But we don't do this properly in `src/modules`. For example, the schnorrsig module uses function from the extrakeys module but there are only `_impl.h` files in  `src/modules/extrakeys` and no `.h` file for schnorrsig to include. \r\n- [ ] The same is true for some internal functions declared in `secp256k1.c`. There's no just header for other files to include.\r\n- [ ] Then make sure that each file includes at least all the stuff it uses, i.e., compiles on its own. Maybe with the help of a tool like [clang-include-fixer](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-include-fixer.html).\r\n- [ ] ...and maybe enforce this on CI.\r\n- [ ] Maybe make sure that each file includes at most the stuff it uses, e.g., with the help of a tool like [include-what-you-use](https://include-what-you-use.org/).\r\n\r\nAgain, I understand that I may the only one suffering, so fixing this may be on me but I still wanted to document my findings here. I don't except anyone disagreeing with the changes the mentioned here but please raise your hand if you do. \r\n\r\n",

Whether you call them `.c` or `_impl.h` is then more a matter of taste in the end and is then orthogonal.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't know if it's worth supporting that as an official compilation method. The reason why we have unity builds is the (former) lack of LTO. I think it was a good idea to separate the precomputed stuff (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1042) because it rarely changes and nothing is lost without LTO. But for the \"normal\" (not precomputed) files, I don't know: we wouldn't want to drop support for unity builds for people that still use compilers without LTO. And compilation times are still very manageable with the existing code base.",

      "body": "@real-or-random Hmm, perhaps my point is more philosophical than practical.\r\n\r\nThe way I like to think about source code organization is that the .h and .c file (or in our case, .h and _impl.h file) are one \"unit\". And to think about dependencies in the code, you think about \"which unit cannot be used without which other unit\". When you have units that depend in that way on each other, you have a \"semantic\" cyclic dependency between those units, which is a sign that those two units should really be one unit, or organized differently.\r\n\r\nSo specifically, if you have a situation where a.c includes b.h, and b.c includes a.h, while not being a cyclic dependency between the actual files, it is a cyclic dependency between the units. And in that sense, e.g. the modules/*/tests_impl.h files aren't proper separate units: modules/*/tests_impl.h depend on functions in tests.c, and simultaneously tests.c includes modules/*/tests_impl.h. In that sense, they're really better thought of as \"part of tests.c, but moved elsewhere to make conditional compilation easy\" than as separate units. Just adding non-impl .h files, without disentangling things, wouldn't change that.\r\n\r\nBut\r\n\r\nOf course, there is no requirement that the situation stay that way. We could properly separate the modules/*/tests_impl.h files; which would probably involve moving some of the shared helper functions in tests.c to a separate file, which can then be included by both tests.c and modulus/*/tests_impl.h\r\n\r\nI think that would be a good idea, actually. And if we do, @apoelstra's suggestion to try compiling all the impl files separately would be a nice way of testing that. Do you imagine that as actually renaming all the _impl.h files to .c in the repository, but just leaving the default compilation mode to still #include them into each other as now? Or do you mean e.g. having the CI script doing the renaming for this particular test? One concern I'd have with actually doing the renaming in-repo is that people building the project in an environment without our build system would actually build that way and get abysmal performance due to lack of inlining of field routines (actually, that's perhaps not uninteresting to test).",

      "body": "> And if we do, @apoelstra's suggestion to try compiling all the impl files separately would be a nice way of testing that. Do you imagine that as actually renaming all the _impl.h files to .c in the repository, but just leaving the default compilation mode to still #include them into each other as now? Or do you mean e.g. having the CI script doing the renaming for this particular test?\r\n\r\nIf the goal is just to solve this issue and test this, then it would suffice to have CI compile the `_impl.h` files (and the other `.h` files). No need to rename them. *edit: and just invoke the compiler on them manually without autotools.* (That's what I meant when I said above that renaming is orthogonal -- I realize that we were writing our comments simultaneously.).",

This PR lays out the groundwork for this level of MSVC support, but doesn't include the configuration logic to enable it yet.\r\n\r\nFor completeness, and implementation of `umulh` and `mulh` are also provided for compilers that support neither the intrinsic nor the int128 type (such as CompCert?).  This also opens up the possibility of removing the 32-bit field and scalar implementations should that ever be desired.",

          "body": "Two primary changes based on the way include statements are handled for the project.\r\n\r\n1. Headers defined by the secp256k1 library are now imported via `#include \"secp256k1.h\"`.\r\n2. Changes to the files that got included are based on the \"include what you use\" tool.\r\n\r\nFor the first point to happen, the Makefile.am got tweaked and declared the `AM_CPPFLAGS` variable and included as a dependency for the different targets on the file. I do not have extensive autoconf/automake experience, so I just went with this variable and while it \"works\", I am not clear if it is the best way to do it.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, within say `secp256k1.c`, one can include the header in the cleaner syntax without the \"include/\" prefix. This also allows other external libraries and build configs to work by defining the lib's include path as such.\r\n\r\nThe latter point makes use of the aggregate tooling built on Clang's different tools called \"include what you use\". Essentially it shows what needs to be declared/removed to include what you use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
