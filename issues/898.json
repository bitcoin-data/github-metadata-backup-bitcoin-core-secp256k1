You can obtain r and s by parsing the signature (easiest way is to call `secp256k1_signature_parse_der` and then `secp256k1_signature_serialize_compact` to get a compact encoding, then R is the first 32 bytes and s is the last 32 bytes).\r\n\r\n`v` is harder, you need to back-compute the signature to determine the full R point. This library does not even do this computation because it is unnecessary for signature verification. Probably your best bet is to use sage or something.",

Recoverable (r, s, v) where r and s are 32 byte big endian integers, and v is a single byte used for recovery (65 total bytes)\r\n3. Bitcoin compact signatures which are a version/recovery value, r, and s.  This too is 65 bytes.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, you can't really disambiguate 2 and 3.  If you KNOW its in format 2 or format 3 you can do this yourself by getting the first or last byte of the compact representation.  The API for compact signatures currently assumes 1 outright.  Even if you know which format the internal representation of the sig is 64 bytes and would need to be modified (i've already corrected the documentation that one should expect it to be sizeof(secp256k1_ecdsa_signature) not 64 exactly)",

I can re-work a patch-set / API to correctly take values in un-serialized form as well as a native implementation of key recovery (IIRC key recovery requires a value between 1-4 to know which of the four points +/- and P/P') to use for the computation of the ephemeral point for recovering the original signing point",

      "body": "@rickmark This library is focused on high-level functionality, exposing safe APIs ideally implementing specific protocols. It deliberately does not expose internals because (a) more risk of shooting yourself in the foot (b) they risk creating a dependency on internal representations which may change. There could be a discussion about changes to that, but this issue isn't the place for that.\r\n\r\nAs far as ECDSA recovery is concerned, I don't see what the outstanding issue to be addressed is here. The recovery module supports creating/serializing/deserializing/converting of signatures with recovery id. Recovery for normal ECDSA signatures isn't possible, as you'd need to guess the recid. I don't expect that we'll want to expand functionality around that.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this due to unclarity about actionable improvements, but feel free to comment if you believe I missed something here.",
