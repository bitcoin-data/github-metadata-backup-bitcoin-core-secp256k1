I've found this project, which seems like a fork: https://github.com/ilaychen/ECDSA-OpenCL\r\n\r\nMaybe it would make sense to upstream some of these changes, to better support GPU acceleration? Am willing to donate 7900 XTX to Sipa.\r\n\r\nI saw this comment: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/502#issuecomment-357767815\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what that meant other than it's possible, and GPUs certainly have improved since that paper was written 10 years ago. It might make sense to revisit this.",

(We don't have a written roadmap, but if we had one, I don't think it would be on it. The lack of responses here confirms this.) That means, feel free to work on it, and maybe then there's a chance to get this accepted. But don't expect us to spend time on this right now.",

Probably not changing entire algorithms ... but maybe if there was like like, an entire new `ecmult_multi_opencl_impl.h` which normally isn't compiled in, that could be ok? And changing the build system and adding new `SECP256K1_` attributes to functions (which are suitably `#ifdef`ed in util.h) woud probably be fine.\r\n",
