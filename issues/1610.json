    "title": "Add extra API for offline/online phases in ECDSA signing",
    "body": "We'd love to split the ECDSA signing operation into two steps:\r\n- an \"offline\" step that is independent on the message,\r\n- an \"online\" step that depends on the message.\r\n\r\nThe advantage here is that the offline step can be precomputed arbitrarily early and do \"most of the computational work\". This is very useful for signers that have a lot of idle time before the signing request comes in, but little time to compute and return the signature. For example, hardware wallets.\r\n\r\nIn ECDSA, the offline step can essentially compute nonce generation + scalar multiplication + nonce modular inversion. These values (\"precomputed material\") are input to the online part. The online part just finishes the ECDSA computation. The online part is extremely fast (we're seeing around 5000x faster than the offline phase in a non-libsecp256k1 proof-of-concept).\r\n\r\nThe precomputed material is secret, can only be used once and needs to be wiped after usage.\r\n\r\nAPI-wise this would probably mean adding two functions: \r\n * `secp256k1_ecdsa_sign_split_phase_precompute()`\r\n * `secp256k1_ecdsa_sign_split_phase_online()`\r\n\r\nThe composition of the two functions compute `secp256k1_ecdsa_sign()`. The input/output behavior does not change. \r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any appetite for this? Happy to write the code for this.\r\n",

      "body": "> this is the drawback of this. It's a major footgun\r\n\r\nI think we have ways to make this less of a footgun. For example, here goes a simple mitigation. We can add to the precomputed material data struct a flag `has_been_used` meant to detect reuse. The consumer function of the struct uses this flag as follows:\r\n - checks on function enter that `has_been_used == NOT_USED_YET`. Refuses to continue if this doesn't check.\r\n - sets `has_been_used` to `ALREADY_USED`\r\n - proceeds to perform the actual computation (possibly following sad paths)\r\n\r\nLike this, a user has to go out of their way to use this unsafely (by modifying fields in an opaque struct). This doesn't cover the contrived case where the user is reusing precomputed material that got persisted _before_ the flag change; but I think that's a narrow corner case that can be dealt with a clear warning: do not reuse nonce material if you're using this API.\r\n\r\nI imagine you've considered similar things for MuSig2, curious what you think.\r\n\r\n> I don't think I'm against giving users advanced and dangerous features, but they should be clearly marked as such\r\n\r\nI think this is the right tradeoff. We can clearly mark the precomputed material as secret and that it cannot be re-used.\r\n\r\n> I'd love to hear your use case and scenario here. [...] Do you personally need/want this, or is this is just a suggestion for improvement?\r\n\r\nI'm asking others to chime in and give better context. Long story short is that we're hitting a performance bottleneck in Bitkey hardware wallet (https://github.com/proto-at-block/bitkey). We need to speed up (by a lot) the signing operation for large transactions if we want to use libsecp256k1.\r\n",

      "body": "> > this is the drawback of this. It's a major footgun\r\n> \r\n> I think we have ways to make this less of a footgun. For example, here goes a simple mitigation. We can add to the precomputed material data struct a flag `has_been_used` meant to detect reuse. [...]\r\n> \r\n> Like this, a user has to go out of their way to use this unsafely (by modifying fields in an opaque struct). \r\n\r\n> This doesn't cover the contrived case where the user is reusing precomputed material that got persisted _before_ the flag change; but I think that's a narrow corner case that can be dealt with a clear warning: do not reuse nonce material if you're using this API.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's contrived. What if you run inside a VM and the VM is reset? What if the caller decides to memcpy the nonce, or write it to disk? (We can document that one must not do this, but this doesn't necessarily mean that people will adhere to the rules.)  \r\n\r\nThe second large concern is that one cannot use deterministic nonce generation when the message is not known. So you'll need a good source of randomness during signing.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, we're apparently willing to accept that risk in the MuSig2 API, so it's not entirely crazy to add a similar API also for ordinary signatures.\r\n\r\n> I imagine you've considered similar things for MuSig2, curious what you think.\r\n\r\nIn the MuSig2 PR, we simply overwrite the nonce with zeros after using it. That's a tiny bit safer and doesn't need a flag. \r\n\r\n> Long story short is that we're hitting a performance bottleneck in Bitkey hardware wallet ([proto-at-block/bitkey](https://github.com/proto-at-block/bitkey)). We need to speed up (by a lot) the signing operation for large transactions if we want to use libsecp256k1.\r\n\r\nI'm curious why you use ECDSA at all in a modern wallet. Schnorr signing is 27% faster on my machine, I'd be curious about the difference on the hardware wallet. The difference is probably mostly due to the RFC6979 hashing in ECDSA, which is overkill. So [switching to a faster nonce derivation function](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/757#issuecomment-697225995) should already speed up things a lot without introducing risks. \r\n\r\nAlso, have you tried with a recent version (>=0.5.0), and have you tried all precomputation table sizes on your platform? (See https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#changed-1, note that we changed the default in 0.5.1) ",
