      "body": "> wtf, as much as UB in C is interesting this is crazy, I thought only __ prefix is UB. sigh.\r\n\r\nAll UB really means is that the standard doesn't make any promises about what happens when your program does it.\r\n\r\nmem* is reserved,  so maybe a later standard/compiler makes a \"memczero\" a built-in function which happens to take the right number of arguments, and .. uh.. zeros all memory accessible to C.  This would make you unhappy.  But (1) they're unlikely to use that specific identifier, (2) if they did it would probably trigger warnings or failures to compile.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing where other kinds of UB causes extremely weird program behaviour is a product of optimization passes. E.g. Some optimization to unroll a loop can't work unless it knows that the loop counter can't wrap, and if it can't unroll it can't vectorize. Fortunately the counter is signed and so it can't wrap by definition.  Compose a bunch of optimizations and you get stuff like the compiler automatically removing blocks of code because it \"proved\" that it could never get executed, much to the programmer's surprise. Without the optimizations the compiler's performance would be much poorer (and it is-- go compile this library with gcc 2.95, it's visibly slower).\r\n\r\nSome identifier language lawyering is extremely unlikely to result in weirdo behaviour through any path like that, only through a genuine clash.  But being pedantically wrong, even if is unlikely doesn't matter, makes it harder to use pedantic static analysis tools--  and also potentially sends an implicit signal to contributors that the authors here don't care about being pedantically correct.  I'd even go a step further and say that if multiple experienced contributors think something might be verboten it should be avoided at least if avoiding it is essentially free: easy to review, harmless to performance, harmless to api compatibility, almost certain to not introduce bugs, like \"pick a different function name\". :) If we thought it was wrong, someone else will later.\r\n",

          "body": "This add a simple static checker based on clang-query, which is a\r\ntool that could be described as a \"clever grep\" for abstract syntax\r\ntrees (ASTs).\r\n\r\nAs an initial proof of usefulness, this commit adds these checks:\r\n  - No uses of floating point types.\r\n  - No use of certain reserved identifiers (e.g., \"mem(...)\", #829).\r\n  - No use of memcmp (#823).\r\n\r\nThe checks are easily extensible.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose is to run the checker on CI, and this commit adds\r\nthe checker to the Travis CI script.\r\n\r\nThis currently requires clang-query version at least 10. (However,\r\nit's not required not compile with clang version 10, or with clang\r\nat all. Just the compiler flags must be compatible with clang.)\r\nClang-query simply uses the clang compiler as a backend for\r\ngenerating the AST.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the compile in which the code is supposed to be\r\ncompiled (e.g., compiler flags such as -D defines and include paths),\r\nit reads a compilation database in JSON format. There are multiple ways\r\nto generate this database. The easiest way to obtain such a database is\r\nto use a tool that intercepts the make process and build the database.\r\n\r\nOn Travis CI, we currently use \"bear\" for this purpose. It's a natural\r\nchoice because there is an Ubuntu package for it. If you want to run\r\nthis locally, bear is a good choice but other tools such as compiledb\r\n(Python) are available.",
