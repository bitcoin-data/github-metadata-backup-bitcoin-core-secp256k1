It has `abort`, and `malloc`/`free`. The story for `abort` is the same as for `fprintf`. Strictly speaking one doesn't need `malloc`/`free` if one uses the prealloc interface but we don't provide consistent include headers for this. (You'll need the normal plus the prealloc header...) So people need to patch our sources which is anything but elegant. https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-secp256k1/blob/master/secp256k1-sys/depend/secp256k1.c.patch\r\n\r\n",

An issue that arises then is that those functions would still be declared in the normal `secp256k1.h` header. This is not terrible but when building programs that use the library, the build would fail at link time when they call these functions accidentally. It would be cleaner not to declare these functions at all. Perhaps this can be done with another \"user\" macro `SECP256K1_ONLY_PREALLOC` that the user can set before including `secp256k1.h` but headers that change their behavior based on macros can be nasty.\r\n\r\n Maybe a cleaner approach would be to reorganize headers such that most functions are in some header like `secp256k1_main.h`, which is then included from `secp256k1.h` (with only malloc functions like `secp256k1_context_create()`) and `secp256k1_preallocated.h` (with their prealloc counterparts). Then the user could easily choose between the two interfaces by including either `secp256k1.h` or  `secp256k1_preallocated.h`.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to know that @sipa and @jonasnick think about this because reorganizing headers would be a pretty fundamental decision. \r\n\r\n> (I do not know the correct syntax and could not set PREALLOC_INTERFACE_ONLY in the makefile).\r\nSyntax looks good actually! I think we could take care of the Makefile / build system; I agree that's a large hurdle for people who are not familiar with it (and arguably also for people who are familiar... )   ",

On the other hand, I find it difficult to commit to this setup given the uncertain future of the context, the role of malloc and scratch spaces. @real-or-random says:\r\n\r\n> But then, when building the library itself, you would then need 'if guard' also functions like secp256k1_context_create().\r\n\r\nI don't think we have to 'if guard' these functions entirely. We could also just change them to something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsecp256k1_context* secp256k1_context_create(unsigned int flags) {\r\n#ifdef PREALLOC_INTERFACE_ONLY\r\n    return NULL;\r\n#else\r\n    /* ... */\r\n    checked_malloc(...);\r\n    /* ... */\r\n#endif\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLess clean for sure than your suggestion, but not terrible imo.\r\n",

          "body": "On top of #1126.\r\n\r\nThis prototypes one possible approach to solve #1095 by implementing the approach described in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1095#issuecomment-1303537678:\r\n\r\n> [...] reorganize headers such that most functions are in some header like `secp256k1_main.h`, which is then included from `secp256k1.h` (with only malloc functions like `secp256k1_context_create()`) and `secp256k1_preallocated.h` (with their prealloc counterparts). Then the user could easily choose between the two interfaces by including either `secp256k1.h` or `secp256k1_preallocated.h`\r\n\r\nNow that I've been working on this, I don't like this approach for various reasons:\r\n - The functions and docs are really cluttered in multiple files.\r\n     - In particular, the context stuff: Creation, cloning, destruction is in `secp256k1_(preallocated).h`, whereas the static context, flags, randomization, and callbacks are in `secp256k1_main.h`. This is hard to grasp for new users and also add confusion for users who don't need the preallocated interface.\r\n     - In general, there's no canonical \"primary\" header anymore. Where do you put general docs that belong to the library as a whole (e.g., the comment that explains the rules of thumb for the order of arguments in API calls)? \r\n  - We need to remove the `#include \"secp256k1.h\"` from the module headers such as `secp256k1_ecdh.h` (because otherwise you couldn't include the module header if you want only the prealloc interface). This means that\r\n     -  this PR is not perfectly backwards-compatible: it will break compilation for  users who include currently only `secp256k1_ecdh.h` and not `secp256k1_ecdh.h`.\r\n     - the dependencies between the header files are not naturally expressed by the #includes\r\n     - you need to include the header files in the right order, i.e., first `secp256k1_(preallocated).h` and then `secp256k1_ecdh.h` because the latter needs the declaration of `secp256k1_context` (and we couldn't even repeat that declaration somewhere to workaround this problem: Compiler tells us `warning: redefinition of typedef 'secp256k1_context' is a C11 feature`...)\r\n\r\nSo I think this PR would indeed make it possible to use only the prealloc interface, but it makes the life harder for everyone, in particular for normal users who have malloc and don't even care about prealloc. I think we should switch to an approach with a macro like `PREALLOC_INTERFACE_ONLY` that you need to set before including `secp256k1.h` (and when compiling the library itself) and that will remove all the functions that depend on malloc.  But please tell me if you disagree. \r\n",

I think the users who care about non-malloc are probably already looking sufficiently closely at the code that a change like that wouldn't be very burdensome.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of my prototype for the latter option (#1166) is that we should do the former.\r\n",
