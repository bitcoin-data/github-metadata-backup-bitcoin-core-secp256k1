That one is nice because @elichai says he wrote it without really looking at our code here. See PR #641.\r\n - [LLFourn/secp256kfun](https://github.com/LLFourn/secp256kfun) in Rust\r\n - [randombit/botan](https://github.com/randombit/botan) in C++  \r\n\r\nI think micro-ecc is a nice option and a good first choice. @elichai would you still interested in getting this in?  \r\n\r\n#641 got stuck because there was no clear commitment to using Rust. I wouldn't opposed to other languages than C in the test but here's a suggestion that I find very  attractive: We could compile the Rust down to (ugly) C using [mrustc](https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc) and vendor this C code. This would mean that we get the best of both worlds: One can compare to an independent simple implementation with the same API and one does not need a Rust compiler to run the tests. The same is true for secp256kfun but I don't know how independent that implementation is. (cc @LLFourn)\r\n\r\nBut before we decide on the way forward, here's another very interesting direction: A much more sophisticated approach to this kind of testing is [cryptofuzz](https://github.com/guidovranken/cryptofuzz) by @guidovranken, which does [differential testings of all kinds of algorithms and libraries](https://guidovranken.com/2019/05/14/differential-fuzzing-of-cryptographic-libraries/). For example, it's used to test libsecp256k1 against Botan on oss-fuzz (https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/pull/5717).\r\n\r\n@guidovranken Were you aware of our OpenSSL cross tests (removed in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/983)? I really wonder how crytofuzz compares against these. I can imagine it would be superior to simply use cryptofuzz and maybe integrate more libraries such as some of the ones mentioned above.\r\n\r\n",

It is also being fuzzed on OSS-Fuzz against Botan by me.\r\n- Botan is supreme, I use it for testing in almost every crypto project\r\n- I don't know if you're running Wycheproof tests on libsec256k1, but if not, you definitely should. I recently found bugs in another secp256k1 library (https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-secp256k1) *after it was audited* by simply running Wycheproof tests on it.\r\n- [Trezor firmware](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware) is very good and is in fact used in the Cryptofuzz fuzzer for libsecp256k1 https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/0c1d5231de61b4166281b4d5685aa66e9f4948a8/projects/bitcoin-core/build_cryptofuzz.sh#L73\r\n\r\nApart from testing sign/verify/recover, it is also a good idea to test point validation, addition and multiplication.",

Unfortunately the Wycheproof tests do not match our semantics entirely, see https://github.com/google/wycheproof/issues/70 .\r\n\r\n@guidovranken Can you also comment on the high-level ideas here? For example, when it comes to functionatily, do you think cryptofuzz is superior in every aspect, or do you think it would still make sense for us to maintain our own cross tests?\r\n\r\nOf course there are also other considerations besides functionality, e.g., build integration etc. For example, if we think we stick to maintain own tests because it's easier to ship them to the user, I imagine we could still have a short run of cryptofuzz on CI.

      "body": "> @guidovranken Can you also comment on the high-level ideas here? For example, when it comes to functionatily, do you think cryptofuzz is superior in every aspect, or do you think it would still make sense for us to maintain our own cross tests?\r\n\r\nA notable shortcoming of CF is that it only compares the results produced by various crypto libraries, but not the absence of results. For example it doesn't confirm the absence of a result in these cases:\r\n\r\n- Point multiplication by 0 is an illegal operation and should not produce a result.\r\n- Point addition/multiplication involving invalid points should not produce a result.\r\n- ECDSA recovery that yields a point at infinity pubkey should not produce a result.\r\n- ECDSA verification involving a pubkey or signature which are not valid points may result `false` or it may not produce a result at all.\r\n\r\nTechnically, each operation run in a crypto library returns a `std::optional<Result>`. It returns `std::nullopt` if it cannot compute a result for any reason, and it returns a `Result` if it can. Once the operation has been run in every crypto library, CF filters out all results which are `std::nullopt`. The remaining set is then compared for differences.\r\n\r\nSo in Python-pseudocode:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nresults = []\r\n\r\n# Run operation in each crypto library\r\nfor module in modules:\r\n    results += [ module.Run(operation) ]\r\n\r\n# Filter out nullopt results\r\nresults = filter(lambda r: r != None, results)\r\n\r\n# Detect discrepancies\r\nif len(set(results)) != 1:\r\n    crash()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis logic exists for a good reason in CF but the corollary is that it can miss certain types of bugs. I do want to address this at some point in the future but for now having a separate test suite is still valuable.",

I think it's good to have something which is easy enough to be run by not only by us but also by our users, packagers, etc. It should ideally just work out of the box without any dependencies.   ",

      "body": "The \"good reason\" is that I allow every library to fail executing an operation for any or no reason. Reasons include:\r\n\r\n- In some libraries I induce random allocation failures, to test its resiliency. If a malloc() fails, then the operation should be allowed to fail.\r\n- In some libraries I hook the PRNG that a library is using (for example for ECDSA signing). For particular outputs of the PRNG, it should be allowed to fail.\r\n- Some libraries have fixed constraints, such as a predefined bignum size. Therefore it is normal that some operations, like multiplication, will fail.\r\n- A library might be implementing only a subset of a primitive in a way that is adequate for its intended usage domain.\r\n\r\nIn some cases it is dubious whether a certain function failing is signalling some specific information.\r\nFor example, if a function which computes a modular inverse fails, is it due to an internal error (e.g. malloc failure) or is it signalling that the inverse does not exist?\r\nI need to review these on a case-by-case basis, so I cannot simply interpret failure as a bug by default.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the ECC point operations all return a `std::optional<component::ECC_Point>`. The `component::ECC_Point` struct is something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct {\r\n\tstd::string X;\r\n\tstd::string Y;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn hindsight it would have been better if this struct also included a field `bool is_infinity`. I could change this, but I would have to do it for all modules, otherwise the whole thing won't compile anymore, so that will take some time.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround I've started to add asserts to various libraries to ensure certain operations conform to certain expectations.\r\n\r\nFor example, in secp256k1, I now have:\r\n\r\n- Multiplication of valid point must succeed except if scalar is 0 (or multiple of order): https://github.com/guidovranken/cryptofuzz/blob/1cacacc30c43ef5ff9d726eeede90831d55a40e0/modules/secp256k1/module.cpp#L1121-L1127\r\n\r\n- Negation of valid point must yield valid point: https://github.com/guidovranken/cryptofuzz/blob/1cacacc30c43ef5ff9d726eeede90831d55a40e0/modules/secp256k1/module.cpp#L1191-L1194\r\n\r\nI want to add similar asserts for point addition and point doubling, where the logic will be:\r\n\r\n- Addition of two valid points must produce a valid point UNLESS both points are negations of eachother, in which case it must produce point at infinity\r\n- Point doubling of a valid point must always succeed\r\n\r\nFeel free to specify additional invariants for any secp256k1 function/operation and I will implement it in the fuzzer.",

Maybe specific releases of the library that are still in widespread use (for example by Ethereum)? I suppose it would be valuable to discover bugs in older versions even if they are fixed in the current version. Sometimes software projects fix bugs while addressing something else, without ever knowing there was a bug, so this can be meaningful. I can even add an additional fuzzer for an older libsecp256k1 version to the OSS-Fuzz project.",

      "body": "> Are there any specific older versions that you think are worthwhile to test?\r\n\r\nI didn't have anything specific in mind. My suggestion was simply based on the observation that a lot of code has been changed during the keys, including replacement of entire internal algorithms (safegcd for modinv, or https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1033/commits/557b31fac36529948709d4bfcc00ad3acb7e83b9 for a very recent example, ...) \r\n\r\n> I suppose it would be valuable to discover bugs in older versions even if they are fixed in the current version. Sometimes software projects fix bugs while addressing something else, without ever knowing there was a bug, so this can be meaningful.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this was my thinking.\r\n\r\n> Maybe specific releases of the library that are still in widespread use (for example by Ethereum)?\r\n\r\nYeah, those are an obvious choice. A lot of projects vendor our code including (old releases of) Bitcoin Core, and lightning implementations, many many altcoins. I think these are good choices for secp256k1, as are the versions bundled by rust-secp256k1 or other bindings as mentioned by Andrew. \r\n\r\nIn the end I think there are so many valid choices that I think I would just pick one or two more or less arbitrary. And covering \"time\" as much as possible is useful and your approach of taking the last commit in a year does the job. I think a mix of old and more recent versions is interesting: A very old version still in use is good as a target to find bugs and more recent versions are good as reference because they tend to have the same API (and support Schnorrsig etc). \r\n\r\nI think if you run cryptofuzz with libsecp256k1 plus 10 other libraries, then I'd suppose adding an old version does not add much if you want to find bugs in the current version. But if you want to find bugs in older versions of libsecp256k1, then of course it makes a lot of sense to run the old version.  \r\n\r\n> I can even add an additional fuzzer for an older libsecp256k1 version to the OSS-Fuzz project.\r\n\r\n(With my limited knowledge of the available resources there etc.,) this sounds interesting at least. \r\n",
