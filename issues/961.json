    "body": "\r\n> By the way, I am wondering whether attribute `SECP256K1_WARN_UNUSED_RESULT` should be added to function `secp256k1_ecdsa_sign`: as (according to the documentation of this function) the nonce generation function may fail, it seems to be a good idea to force callers to check the value returned by this function. What do you think about this?\r\n\r\nThe default nonce generation function will fail only with astronomically low probability. So if you know that you have a valid secret key and you use the default nonce function (99% of the use cases), it's okay not to check the return value.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I think we're not entirely consistent here... For example, the same argument would apply to `secp256k1_ec_seckey_verify` (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/master/include/secp256k1.h#L632). Even `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_negate` \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/master/include/secp256k1.h#L650 has  `SECP256K1_WARN_UNUSED_RESULT` even if it's guaranteed to return 1 according to the docs...\r\n\r\nMaybe we should have a look at this in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/783 or in a follow up PR.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @real-or-random in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/960#issuecomment-873285651_\r\n\r\nSo I wonder what our (unwritten) policy for `SECP256K1_WARN_UNUSED_RESULT` should be. I think we're overdoing it in the two mentioned cases but I'm happy to hear other opinions.",

The failure case for ecdsa_sign is when the secret is invalid, e.g. an attacker has convinced you to tweak your key in various ways that result in invalid private keys.\r\n\r\nOk, I was wrong. The correct statement is that the default nonce generation will never fail.\r\necdsa_sign fails if \"the nonce generation function failed, or the secret key was invalid.\"\r\n\r\nDo you have an opinion about `SECP256K1_WARN_UNUSED_RESULT`?",
