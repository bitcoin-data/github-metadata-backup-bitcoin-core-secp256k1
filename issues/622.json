See also #184 \r\n\r\nRelated, we should also provide packaging instructions for common OSes, see #545",

      "description": "Motivation: libsecp is already widely used today, but often in a terribly outdated version. It's likely that a release process would help with that. Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",

Moreover,\r\nit meant that basic-config.h cannot define ECMULT_GEN_PREC_BITS,\r\nessentially making this file specific for use in gen_context.c.\r\n\r\nAfter this commit, gen_context.c include only libsecp256k1-config.h.\r\nbasic-config.h is not necessary anymore for the modules used in\r\ngen_context.c because 79f1f7a made the preprocessor detect all the\r\nrelevant config options.\r\n\r\nOn the way, we remove an unused #define in basic-config.h.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis now cherrypicks https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/918/commits/71d76d1b3cb0480620a2071c5cdee033218eb37d from #918.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, basic-config.h is unused. We could simply remove it. But with the goal of improving non-autotools (#622) in mind, I don't think that's the best approach. Here are better options:\r\n\r\n * We keep the file and it can help users to facilitate non-autotools builds. (This would mean we'll merge #916 on top of this PR, which now should work properly now).\r\n * We take a step back and think about a better solution for non-autotools builds. I'm willing to work on a PR.\r\n   * The library currently builds cleanly with a simply compiler invocation except that `ECMULT_WINDOW_SIZE` and `ECMULT_GEN_PREC_BITS` are not defined. So I suggest we define default values for those in the corresponding files. Then the library would be cleanly without any necessary config.\r\n   * We provide the user with a template config file that documents the available config options. Creating such a template is not too hard using autotools, which supports this for the specific purpose of allowing non-autotools builds.\r\n   * We add a (then hopefully simple) section to the README that explains building without autotools.\r\n   * We add a CI job that tests that the build works with the command from the README.
