      "description": "Motivation: libsecp is already widely used today, but often in a terribly outdated version. It's likely that a release process would help with that. Moreover, it simplifies using libsecp which may prevent developers from using less well tested alternatives. Lastly, without releases it's difficult to update the library in an organized fashion and communicate these updates.\r\n\r\nRelease Goals:\r\n\r\n- Stabilize API and documentation for functionality that exist today.\r\n- Fix a few known bugs.\r\n- Make ECDH non-experimental.\r\n\r\nThis milestone can be discussed in issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/286.",

      "body": "We discussed this a while ago (on IRC? I can't remember), and everyone tended towards not doing it.\r\n\r\nThe main argument against it is that it will interrupt open PRs. Personally I think the style here is fine, and our culture is to point a lot of nits, so I don't think there are terrible violations of the style such as obviously wrong indentation etc. \r\n\r\nA while ago I tried to come up with reasonable settings for clang-format but it was hard and I gave up after a while. It mostly complains about spacing (around operators, around `*`), and I think it's somewhat annoying to make this consistent as there is no clear preference. Also there are many locations in the code where we break common intentionally, e.g., long constants and multiple statements on a single line:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/master/src/scalar_4x64_impl.h#L75\r\n\r\nI think none of this is a definitive thing. If someone objects, or manages to come up with nice settings that work and are not too invasive, I believe we could reconsider this. I'm closing this for now because I believe it's not really clear how to solve it.",
