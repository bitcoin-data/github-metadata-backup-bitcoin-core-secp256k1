(We cannot simply add `static`, because that would imply internal linkage which conflicts which the external linkage that we need due to the use of multiple compilation units.)  \r\n\r\nThere's no generic C language feature to fix this. But we can fix this in both GCC and clang by any of the following (in descending order of my personal preference).\r\n1. Add `__attribute__ ((visibility (\"hidden\")))` to the `extern` declarations\r\n2. Wrap the `extern` declarations in `#pragma GCC visibility push(hidden)` ... `#pragma GCC visibility pop`. \r\n    1. We could in fact do this with the entire code base (excluding where we include foreign headers). :shrug: Not entirely sure if it doesn't create further problems...\r\n3. Add `-Wl,--exclude-libs,libsecp256k1_precomputed.a` to `LDFLAGS` but that's kind of pointless to cover the case of default visibility, which typically occurs when the user invokes the compiler manually without even caring about `-fvisibility`.\r\n\r\nIn any case, `-fvisibility=hidden` would not be strictly necessary on the command line anymore (except for rather exotic compilers such as `icc` which understand it but not the attribute or the `#pragma`. This would then help [manual builds](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/929) of shared libraries.\r\n\r\n",

(We cannot simply add `static`, because that would imply internal linkage which conflicts which the external linkage that we need due to the use of multiple compilation units.)\r\n> \r\n> There's no generic C language feature to fix this. But we can fix this in both GCC and clang by any of the following (in descending order of my personal preference).\r\n> \r\n>     1. Add `__attribute__ ((visibility (\"hidden\")))` to the `extern` declarations\r\n> \r\n>     2. Wrap the `extern` declarations in `#pragma GCC visibility push(hidden)` ... `#pragma GCC visibility pop`.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid you're chasing after some ghosts here because as far as I can tell from my tests it's perfectly possible to use the `export` keyword without forcing default visibility despite what some of the docs say.\r\n\r\nNotice that these exports aren't present in the linux shared libraries, only mingw.\r\n\r\nThe problem as I see it is that mingw is currently using `__attribute__ ((visibility (\"default\")))` to mark its external symbols. However the linker machinery seems to only be activated by `__declspec (dllexport)`. I had always kinda assumed they're equivalent, but minimal test-cases show that the differences are exactly our problems :)\r\n\r\n For me, making that switch (along with #1242) solves all current export problems that I'm aware of.\r\n\r\n```patch\r\ndiff --git a/include/secp256k1.h b/include/secp256k1.h\r\nindex 325f35eb..ed5bbc9a 100644\r\n--- a/include/secp256k1.h\r\n+++ b/include/secp256k1.h\r\n@@ -148,3 +148,3 @@ typedef int (*secp256k1_nonce_function)(\r\n /* Symbol visibility.
